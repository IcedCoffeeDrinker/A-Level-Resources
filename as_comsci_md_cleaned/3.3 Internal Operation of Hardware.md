# 3.3 Internal Operation of Hardware
Every hardware device requires a program that enables its basic functionalities. This program is called a 'device driver'.

## Magnetic Media
note: peripheral devices refer to devices that can be connected to a computer
- first ever medium used as file store

*Diagram Labels:*
- *Side view:* spindle, platters, actuator arm
- *Top view:* block, sector, track
- *Note:* Same tracks on multiple platters = cylinder

- Data is stored in tracks, which go all around the platter.
- Small areas of the disk can be magnetized to set the bit
    - the read-write head uses electromagnetism to write and detect magnetic fields.
- all platters spin continuous, and at the same speed
- closely related data is often stored close to the same radius, but on different platters -> same track radia on different platters are called 'cylinder' preferably
- While data is stored on continuous tracks, the platters get segmented fast when editing and removing files
    - reduces performance
- Hard Drives are direct access read-write devices but are considered sequential as data has to be accessed in order
    - a sector is selected and read 'in order', meaning that for each reading the entire sector will be re-read.

## Optical Media
- Compact Disk (CD) -> laser
    - CD digital audio (CD-DA)
        - music
    - CD-ROM (read-only)
        - software distribution
    - CD-RW (read-write)
        - -> storage medium
        - -> digital versatile disk (DVD)
            - -> Blue-ray disk (BD)
                - # most effective as blue light can be focused even tighter -> more data

- One single spiral track
- uses sectors
- laser moves to follow track
- 'pits and lands'
- intensity of laser reflection is detected
- CD-RW/DVD-RW heat up an alloy which goes amorphous or crystaline after cooling, depending on the laser's intensity -> depending on alloy, more heat can be either crystaline or amorphous
- amount of data that can be stored is dependent on
    - physical limitations of the disk
    - wavelength of the light: smaller wav. len -> more intense -> easier to focus
- speed depends on the speed of rotation of the disk

## Solid-State Media
- uses semiconductors (transistors) to save memory in little cells
    - transistors are arranged into 'NAND gates'
- solid-state media is also known as flash-media, as 'blocks' of memory can be erased all at once (in a flash)
- Reading and writing are managed by a 'NAND flash controller'
- Before data can be written the memory in that place first has to be erased
    - unlike e.g. magnetic tape
- currently the technology of choice for removable data, secondary storage generally
- most common forms:
    - solid state drive (SSD)
    - USB flash drive
- despite the abscence of moving parts there is a limited amount of read-write cycles per cell
- degradation can be detected and compensated for by the computer
- Data is accessed in pages (one page at a time)

## Screen Display
### liquid-crystal display (LCD):
- uses liquid crystal, polarizers and a backlight to create images
- depending on the voltage applied to the liquid crystal at the sub-pixel, the polarization changes
    - this leads to a shift in the amount of light passing through the polarizing filter
    - the light for each sub-pixel passes a color filter (red, green, or blue)
### Cathode Ray Tube (CRT):
- an electron gun shoots electrons onto the screen which is coated with a layer of phosphor and starts glowing where the gun hit
    - pixels are defined by the size of steps the gun takes
    - an electro magnet is used to controll the beam's direction
- Color CRT works by creating a matrix of red, blue and green phosphor and shooting each sub-pixel

## Printers
note: Printers use subtractive color creation. Colors used are cyan, magenta, yellow, black

### Inkjet Printer:
- paper is fed in
- printhead moves accross the paper to deposit drops of ink

### Laser Printer:
- paper pulled in
- roller adds charge
- laser removes charge
- toner powder sticks
- hot roles apply preassure and 'bake' the powder

## Plotters
### Graphic Plotter (2D)
- used for highly detailed drawings in engineering
- is able to display SVGs
- Can change toolhead, uses rails to move on two axis, tool head

### 3D Printer (Plotter)
- used for manufacturing
- a nozle squirts material onto a buid plate layer by layer
- often the print has to be cured to ensure that the layers stick together

## Input devices for general purpose computer systems
### Keyboard
- with its own microcontroller the keyboard converts keystrokes into binary codes for keys.
- Keys are positioned over a so called 'key matrix' which consists of two sets of grids.
    - on a keypress both matrecies are connected below the key
    - the micro controller has to continuously check for input
- The microprocessor watches the signal from the matrecies with a binary sequence for a character from its ROM

### Screen (GUI)
- Screens can be used as part of the input system too.
- graphical user interfaces provide digital controll surfaces that can be selected and manipulated
- note that the physical screen is considered an output device though interaction with the digital screen is considered input
    - a 'pointing mechanism' is required and turns the GUI into an input device

## Touch screens
### Using ultrasound or infrared?
- Emitters send waves to detectors. A finger causes reduced signal strength where the finger is.

### Resistive Touch Screen
- two grids are seperated by a thin space.
    - on touch both connect at the point of contact and the voltage is divided
- A soft screen is required to allow for slight banding

### Capacitive Touch Screen
- when the finger touches the screen it causes a change in capacitive charge directly beneath the screen.
- electrodes span the width of the screen
    - an xy grid is used to determine the exact location of contact
- projective capacitive touch (PCT) allows for multiple fingers to be detected simultanously. (It's one of the newest versions of capacitive touch)

## Input of Graphics
- webcam / digital camera
    - videos and images
- scanner
    - highly detailed and accurate digital copy
    - how it works:
        - a light source covering the width of the paper moves over the stationary paper.
        - The light gets reflected by mirrors onto a 'charge coupled device' (CCD)
        - A CCD gives an analog signal proportional to the amount of light it recieves
            - an analog to digital converter is needed.
            - it mainly consists of photo-sensitive cells

## Input and Output of Sound
### Microphone
- uses a diaphrame to detect vibrations in the air
- electric circuit detects vibrations and outputs an analogue signal
    - condenser microphone measures change in capacitance
    - alternatively a 'piezoelectric crystal' can be used
- analog-to-digital converter (ADC) is needed

### Speaker
- basically a reverse microphone:
    - signal converted by DAC
    - electromagnet causes vibration in the dia phragme

(Note connecting Microphone and Speaker): both require an audio card
