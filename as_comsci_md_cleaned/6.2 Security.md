# 6.2 Security

## Threats to system and data security:
- human error (mistakes)
- internal problems/mismanagement
- natural disasters
- unauthorized intrusion
- installation of malware

hacker => someone that wants to gain unauthorized access to a system or data
malware => **malicious software** that wants to harm the system

## Types of Malware
- **Virus:** tries to replicate itself into other executable programms
    - ↳ boot sector virus: runs on boot
    - ↳ macro virus: hides in macros, usually Word, Excel, PowerPoint
- **worm:** runs independently and spreads to other hosts (computers)
    - ↳ a spreading virus
- **logic bomb:** stays inactive until some condition is met
- **Trojan horse:** replaces all or part of an initially useful program
- **Spyware:** collects information and sends it to another system
- **bot:** uses the infected computer to launch attacks

## Introduction of Malware:
- **Phishing:** sending a digital message from a seemingly authentic source that asks for confidential information
- **Pharming:** A mock up website that asks for your credentials while impersonating a different website
- **keylogger:** records all keys pressed by the user

## Sources of Vulnerability
### User:
- creates weak passwords
- might fall for phishing or pharming attacks
- introduce malware:
    - attaching e.g. a foreign USB
    - opening an email attatchment
    - accessing malicious websites
    - download malicious files

### System:
- The OS usually is very vulnerable.
    - More complex OS -> more weak spots
- Viruses hidden in default macros/dependencies of software
    - ↳ will always be installed
- buffer overflow can be used to gain unauthorized access
    - ↳ hacker overides permission files

## Security Measures
### Disaster recovery
=> restart programs fast to prevent other dependent programs from breaking down
- Disaster Recovery Contingency Plan
    - provides a packup system at any times
    - ↳ packup system is called 'hot site'
    - ↳ has to be remote from original system (bc. e.g. earthquake)

### Parallel System Update
- used to run a system continuously, e.g. web-services
- has two systems in parallel:
    - one updating
    - one providing the service

### User Authentication
- Even single-user systems should have user-accounts
    - ↳ restricts easy done damage
- Users have to authenticate themselves with (usually) an ASCII password
- a good password is long and complex
- Alternative authentication methods:
    - biometric auth. (e.g. Face ID or fingerprint)
    - security tokens: physical hardware for identification (e.g. NFC)

### Good Practice
- turn of computer when it's not in use
- enter the password in secret
- keep the password only in your mind
- organizations banning the use of portable storage devices

### Firewall
- primary defence against malware
- => a hardware device that inspects and controlls all traffic
    - ↳ sometimes it's a software
- checks system addresses and IPs
- (sometimes) checks for malicious data
- can include filters (e.g. for inappropriate websites)

### Digital Signature
- a way of verifying a computer's identity (e.g. sometimes sent along emails)

### Anti-Virus Software
=> software that regularly scanns the system for malware/viruses and deletes them

### Intrusion Detection
- monitors physical inputs and checks for differences in performed actions
    - ↳ recognizes when someone remotely takes controll or programs that act as users

### Arms Race
- Hacking software and anti-malware software become increasingly sophisticated
- It's a constant race of trying to supass eachother

## Security Measures for Data Protection
### Data Loss
- reasons for data loss:
    - storage device gets corrupted/destroyed
    - system crashes
    - faulty deletion/overwriting of files
    - file location forgotten
- A good backup procedure:
    - full backups made regularly (e.g. weekly)
    - two or more full backups kept in storage
    - daily incremental backups
    - backups stored outside of the system
        - ↳ fire-and flood proof location
- Ways of copying continuously changing data:
    - freeze file store while copying -> temporarily use memory as storage
    - use of disk-mirroring: files are always stored on two identical disks during normal operation
        - ↳ one disk is remote

### Restricting Access to Data
- user categories that restrict information available (e.g. employee vs. employer vs. admin)
- **Authorization policies** grant access rights (e.g. read or write) to users

### Storage Encryption
- All data on a disk can be encrypted to give intruders a hard time
