# 7.2 Copyright & Licensing

## Copyright
-> formally acknowledged ownership

### When copyright can be claimed:
- a person creates an original piece of software -> he claims copyright
- He actually works for a company -> organization claims copyright

### When copyright Doesn't Apply:
- Ideas
- Already published work owned by someone else

### Types of media that Copyright can be claimed for:
- a literary work (e.g. book)
- musical composition
- film
- music recording
- radio / TV broadcast
- work of art
- computer program

### Why Copyright exists:
- enable people to claim the profit of their hard work
- prevent others from profiting without credit to the original creator

### Widely Accepted Copyright Laws
- registration must include date of creation
- a period for which the copyright applies
- what happens when the owner dies
- How to indicate copyright, e.g. Â©
- Owner can set rules for use: e.g. ethics
- When a work is bought, copies can be created for personal use

## Commercial Software
-> users buy an 'end-user license'
  -> permission to use the software, not own it

### Variations of Software Licenses
1. a fee is paid for each copy
2. company buys a 'site licence'
   -> allows for $n$ copies to run simultaneously
3. Discounts may apply e.g. for educational purposes

## Licenses Free of Charge
*   **Shareware**
    - Software made available on a trial (limited time)
    - Might include the full software or a limited version of it
    - Examples:
        - Free trial
        - Testing / Beta versions
*   **Freeware**
    - Might be a full, limited, or old version
    - Has no trial and the end-user license is free

> Any license will define limitations on how the software can be used

> Rarely will the sourcecode be provided for any commercially licensed software

### When commercial Software is Used:
- software is available and user friendly
- is created to work with already installed software
- continuous support and maintenance provided
- Shareware might allow for suggestions for improvement (bad reason)
- Freeware is sufficient

## Open Source (Open Licensing)
*   Software for which the source code is available
*   Usually users are allowed to:
    - modify
    - distribute ... the software, though within the defined bounds by the license
    - use
*   Open source promotes
    - collaborative development
*   the sustainability of a software -> people will update it

## Free Software (not free of charge)
-> open source software sub-category which uses 'copyleft'
*   **copyleft:** any modified source code must be made available under the same conditions of usage
*   Free software has the following requirements:
    - a program's inner workings must be accessible
    - one can modify the code
    - one can run the code for anything
    - one can redistribute the code, modified or not

## Organizations
### Open Source Initiative:
*   Philosophy: Distribute software free of charge and promote collaboration in development

### Free Software Foundation:
*   Philosophy: Users should be free to use software in any way they wish (Not necessarily free of charge)
*   usually includes a small fee for distribution cost
*   All published software is 'free software' -> copyleft applies

### Why to use Open Source software
- it's free / cheap
- software can be customized to fit one's needs
- Fosters collaboration with community
