# 5.3 Compilers & Interpreters

## Interpreter
*   Source code is compiled at runtime
    *   ↳ code gets translated and then executed, for every line
    *   ↳ if an error occurs / is found, the program halts immediately
*   code is translated into **intermediate code**: e.g. assembly or byte code
    *   ↳ (not machine code!)
*   Both source-code and interpreter are needed at runtime
    *   => code has to be re-interpreted for every execution
    *   ↳ generally slower at runtime, faster for development

## Compiler
*   reads program line by line and converts it to **intermediate code**
*   if an error is found it's recorded, program continues
    *   ↳ compiler spits out list with all errors at the end
*   If no errors occurred, intermediate code is converted to object code.

### On runtime
*   program is extremely fast
*   only compiled machine code needed
    *   => source code and compiler aren't needed
    *   => source code stays secret

**Object code**: Platform specific machine code that has yet to be linked with files, libraries or other object code, and made executable.

**Intermediate Code**: Low-Level platform-independent code which is not yet fully executable (e.g. Bytecode)

## Interpreter Pro-Con
+ fast for development; errors found fast
- errors are only found at execution of the faulty line of code
- the source code has to be shared with all users
- the interpreter is required to run the program

## Compiler Pro-Con
+ the executable can be distributed on its own
+ source code stays secret
+ only the object code required
+ faster on runtime
- less secure as it might contain hidden viruses
- slower at development -> recompile again for every error

## Java
*   Java is extra :)
*   source code is converted to universal 'Java byte code'
*   byte code is interpreted by system-specific 'Java Virtual Machine'
    *   => Java byte code works for all Java VMs

## IDEs
Integrated Development Environment
### Prettyprinting:
*   more comprehensible code representation that automatically occurs?
    - color-coding
    - formatting, etc

### Content-Sensitive Prompts:
*   code recommendation
*   autocomplete
*   2025 edit: vibe coding x)

### Dynamic Syntax Checks:
### Expanding & collapsing code blocks
### Debugging support
*   => breakpoints: program stops when reached
*   => line-by-line execution (manual)
*   => examine current program state -> variables, etc.
