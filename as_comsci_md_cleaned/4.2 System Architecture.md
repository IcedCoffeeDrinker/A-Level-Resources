# 4.2 System Architecture

## CPU performance
-   **clock speed** (measured in Hz = cycles per second)
    -   a given number of instructions is executed every cycle
-   **Cache Size**
    -   having to access slower RAM takes longer, having more cache is beneficial
-   **Cache Type**: there is a trade-off between latency and the hit rate
    -   hit-rate: how fast data is found -> highly dependent on size
    -   speed vs. size tradeoff
    -   solution: multiple levels of cache
-   **Number of cores**: today's chips have multiple processing units (PUs)
    -   double cores doesn't quite mean double the actions/speed, it's more complicated
    -   multiple cores share a larger cache, but each also has their own

## System Bus
-   parallel transmission component
    -   many parallel wires transmit an array of bits (at the same time)
-   there are other busses than the system bus located inside the CPU
-   System bus connects the CPU to memory and input-output devices:
    -   address bus -> memory address
    -   data bus -> actual data
    -   control bus -> e.g. timing of the system
-   \* I/O = input output

*Diagram Description:*
- **Components**: CPU, Memory (controller), I/O (controller)
- **Buses**:
    - **Control Bus**: Bidirectional arrows connecting CPU, Memory, and I/O.
    - **Address Bus**: Unidirectional arrows from CPU to Memory and I/O.
    - **Data Bus**: Bidirectional arrows connecting CPU, Memory, and I/O.

### Address Bus
-   only carries addresses (one at a time)
-   loaded by the MAR in the CPU, timed by CU
-   one way street from CPU to memory and I/O devices
    -   recieved by memory controller or I/O controller

### Data Bus
-   carries data, either: instruction, value, address
-   bidirectional -> CPU, memory and I/O devices can load / recieve data
-   ! some systems only allow transfer between memory and I/O through CPU, other computer systems allow for direct transmission

### Control Bus
-   is for communication between the system and the Control Unit in the CPU
-   has only eight wires, doesn't need more (usually)
-   carries the system clock signal -> ensures syncronization of components

## A word
-   a 'word' describes the smallest unit of data that can be transferred between components at once. (max capacity of CPU)
-   the word length is defined by the system architecture, usually 16, 32, or 64 bits, respectively :) always in byte increments
    -   registers usually match the word length,
    -   bus-width is also dependent on the word length

## Bus width & memory addressing
-   The width of the address bus determines how many individual addresses can be reached.
-   each address refers to a single byte
-   systems with small address bus width use special techniques for indirect addressing, which is slower
-   the address bus width is ideally, but not neccessarily the size of a word
    -   if not a full word, then probably half a word.

## I/O ports

---
*Diagram Description:*
-   CPU is connected via `system bus` to the `I/O controller`.
-   The `I/O controller` has:
    -   `internal ports` which connect to `integral devices`.
    -   `external ports` which connect to `peripheral devices`.
---
-   I/O controller, aka device controller manages connections between CPU and I/O devices

## Other Bus Types

### Universal Series Bus (USB)
-   a hierarchy is supported by the USB standard
    -   The computer is at the root of this hierarchy
-   Computer can connect 127 devices

### Special Multimedia Ports
-   Video Graphics Array (VGA) port
    -   for second monitor, no sound
-   High Definition Multimedia Interface (HDMI) port
    -   video + audio
