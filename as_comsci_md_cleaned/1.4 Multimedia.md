## Representing images in binary
- Bitmap: an image stored as a 2d array of pixels
- Pixel: an individual picture element
    = the smallest distinguishable feature
- Monitor: VDU (Visual display unit)
- resolution: width x height, but also can be eg. ppi (pixels per inch)
    -> usually describes pixel amount / density
- representing an analog picture in binary: a grid is placed over the image and each color gets mapped to a binary representation (eg. 1 or 0 for black & white, or multiple bits for color)
- color depth: number of allocated bits for each pixel's color (eg. color depth of 3 is $2^3$ possibilities)
- increase in resolution and color depth increases filesize

> Size (b) = W x H x D (width, height, color depth)
> in pixels, in bits
> $$ \text{Size (B)} = \frac{W \times H \times D}{8} $$

- Metadata: data about data
    - required to display an image properly, stored alongside the raw image data
    - Required:
        Filename, file format, color depth, resolution
    - Non-Required: camera details, etc.

## Representation of Sound in Binary

### Analogue vs. Digital
- Analog is continuous, has no defined range -> often shown as wave
- Digital data has defined ranges and only is able to show discrete values

### Digitising Sound
- Sampling: recording a signal at regular intervals
- Sampling frequency: number of samples taken per second of audio in Hz
    -> Higher Sampling Frequency -> better sound accuracy but larger file
- Sample Size: How many bits are available for each sample (eg. sample size of 3 is $2^3$ steps so only 8 values)
    -> Sample size corresponds to levels of loudness
- Bit rate: number of bits used per second
    - Bit rate (bps) = Sampling frequency (Hz) x Sample size (b)
- Total Filesize = Bit rate (b) x Time (s)

`Sampling Frequency = Sampling Rate` | Synonyms
`Sample Size = Sample Resolution` |

### Advantages of Analog Sound:
+ more accurate representation of sound
+ can be represented by voltage strength
- vulnerable to noise, hard for long-distance transmission
+ high information density
- needs amplification

### Advantages of Digital Sound:
-> less influenced by noise: clear 1/0 data transmission
- less accurate, lower information density
- great for binary systems and long-distance transmission
- can carry much more information easily (if bit rate is high enough)
    -> able to carry two waves at once (eg.)

## Vector graphics
- Images stored as vector graphic files consist of many individual drawing objects
- each drawing object has properties
- those objects, with their properties, are stored in a drawing list
- properties contain attributes such as geometrical shape, color, and shape-specific information
- drawing Objects are defined relative to an imaginary drawing canvas, not with an explicit position
- vector images are therefore scalable
- for a vector graphic to be displayed on a conventional display it has to be transformed into a bitmap

```
Drawing list [
    DrawingObject_0(x,y, etc.)
    DrawingObject_1(x,y, color, ...)
    ...
]
