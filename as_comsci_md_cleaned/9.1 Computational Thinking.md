# 9.1 Computational Thinking
=> Step-based problem-solving through ordered logical reasoning

## Five Components:

### Abstraction
=> Summarize the key information which is important to the goal
- ↳ Filter unnecessary complexity and unrequired information
- e.g. abstract datatypes remove a layer of complexity by grouping similar data together and providing tools that work with this group

### Decomposition
=> Breaking problems into smaller more manageable problems
- e.g. functions

### Data Modelling
=> Identifying what information is needed in which way
- ↳ this ties into creating custom abstract datatypes
- e.g. The program requires a queue-like datatype, but no such datatype is provided -> an abstract datatype is coded

### Pattern Recognition
=> Finding patterns in problems to find common solutions
- improves efficiency in work and code
- e.g. There are many standard algorithms that cover most logical problems

### Algorithm Design
=> Define step-by-step instructions to solve a problem
