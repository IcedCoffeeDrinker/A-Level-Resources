# 8.3 Normalization (Database-related)
=> Restructure databases to reduce data redundancy

## Normal Forms
=> Describe the grade of optimization regarding data redundancy
- 1NF has lots of abundancy, 3NF is aimed for

### 1NF:
- All values (fields) are **atomic**, meaning that they hold only a single value, not a list.
- Each row has a **primary key**.

### 2NF:
- database fulfills 1NF
- **no partial dependencies of non-key attributes on composite primary keys**
	- ask yourself: could I identify this (non-key) attribute with only part of the composite primary key? -> move it to it's own new table
	- single primary key relations are automatically in 2NF

`Student Class Info (StudentID, ClassID, Grade, Teacher)`
*primary key (composite)*
> grade is dependent on student id and class id -> it's good
> teacher is only dependent on Class id -> it ain't good

`StudentClassInfo(StudentID, ClassID, Grade)`
`Class(ClassID, teacher)`
*foreign key*

### 3NF:
- database fulfills 2NF
- **non-key attributes don't contextually depend on any other non-key attributes**

`CharacterDescription(DescriptionID, described character, book title)` X
> `book title` depends on `described character`

`Character Description(DescriptionID, characterID)`
`Characters(CharacterID, character name, book title)`

Summarized:
3NF means each non-key attribute is dependent on the primary key, the whole primary key, and nothing but the primary key.

## Un-Normalized Data
=> Data is said to be 'un-normalized' if it contains repeating groups or straight up lists
e.g. `(CustomerID, Name, Phone number #1, Phone number #2)`
*repeating group*
- repeating groups are sets of attributes which represent similar data
> leads to data redundancy because not all customers have two phone numbers
