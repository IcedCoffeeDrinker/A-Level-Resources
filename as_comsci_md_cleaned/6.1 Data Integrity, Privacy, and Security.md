# 6.1 Data Integrity, Privacy and Security

## Data Integrity
*   The requirement for data to be _accurate_ and _up-to-date_
    *   'accurate' might mean unchanged, e.g. when transfering a file

## Data Privacy
*   keeping data safe (private)
*   individuals generally have control over who has access to their data
    *   which of their data is being shared
*   organizations also have a right to data privacy
*   _Data protection laws_ enforce data privacy
    -   major focus on protecting individuals from corporations
        *   data only used for purposes agreed upon
        *   organizations have to ensure data privacy and integrity
    -   Those laws can't _garantee_ anything

## Data Security
*   The requirement for data to not get lost, corrupt, or change unwantedly.
*   Data security is a prerequisite for data integrity and privacy, as lost/corrupted data is useless
*   System security is crucial for data security:
    -   system executes requested tasks as long as needed
        *   prevent data los
    -   ensures only authorized users can access the data /sys
