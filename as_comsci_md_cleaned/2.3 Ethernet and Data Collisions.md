# 2.3 Ethernet and Data collisions

# Internet Protocols

## TCP / IP

- Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)
- Intenet Protocol (IP)
- TCP/IP = the Internet Protocol Suite (actually there are way more protocols involved with the internet)

## Ethernet

- A standardised family of protocols, world-wide agreed upon
    - IEEE 802.3 == Ethernet standard
- Related protocols that describe how nodes on the same network segment format and transmit data
- Ethernet (cables) are for local (LAN) connections (usually bus or star topology)
    - once used for broadcasting type topologies, e.g. star topology with a hub as central device
- Ethernet is part of the link layer where data packets are referred to as frames
- usually Ethernet cables are four twisted pair copper cables
    - twists help to cancel out electromagnetic interference
    - wires are twisted at different rates to reduce interference even further
- Ethernet consists of the bottom two layers of the OSI model: ‘physical’ and ‘data link’
    - physical layer consists of cabling and devices (e.g. hubs, switches, bridges, gateways)
    - data link layer consists of ‘Logical Link Control’ (LLC) and ‘Media Access Control’ (MAC)

## WiFi or LAN

- Wireless transmission with radio waves through the air
    - Radio includes lower-frequency electromagnetic waves
- A **cannel** represents a small range of radio frequencies, is pre-defined and labelled with a number
- When broadcasting on a channel the signal spreads out a little into neighbouring channels causing interference / data collision
    - communication has therefore to be spaced out ideally with channels in between
- Data transmitted over WiFi is encrypted using the WPA (now WPA2) security protocols (WPA = Wi-Fi Protected Access)

### Wifi Pro and Cons

**Pro:**

- More versatile than cable → devices can move freely
- Cheap to set up, less spacial disruption (no cables)
- Easily expandable: both adding new devices and extending range

**Con:**

- Can cause interference and also suffer from interference more easily then wired networks
- Has high attenuation, meaning that the signal strength degenerates fast
    - >> less reliable
- Vulnerable to hacking and unwanted access
- Slower than wired

# CSMA/CD - Ethernet collision detection

**carrier sense multiple access with collision detection**

- sent data can corrupt if nodes broadcast simultaneously
    - voltages inside the Ethernet cables would interfere with each other
- CSMA/CD was used to prevent corruption and resend the data if necessary
- How CSMA/CD works:
    1. Check for voltage on the cable (a voltage on the cable means data is currently being sent)
    2. If there is already voltage (=a signal), wait a random amount of time before checking again
    3. If no signal is detected, start transmission
    4. Continuously check for collision 
    5. If no collision, continue transmission
    6. If a collision is detected, strop transmission, send a jamming warning signal, after a random time try again
- Now Star configurations have switches, not hubs as central device. Switches bake broadcasting redundant
    - Each end-device is connected with an individual full duplex link, making data collision impossible
