# 7.1 Ethics
=> Collectively agreed upon moral principles that decide between right or wrong

=> In comsci: Ethics = Rules of Conduct

- Professionals should seek ethical guidance by organizations which provide a code of conduct:
	- e.g.
		- (BCS) British Computer Society
		- (ACM) Association for Computing Machinery
		- (IEEE) Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers

- 8 principles by IEEE and ACM:
	1. Software engineers should always act within public interest
	2. Software engineers should act in the best interest of employer/client
	3. Products and modifications meet highest professional standards
	4. Maintain integrity and independence in their professional judgement
	5. Promote ethical approach as a manager
	6. Advance the profession of software engineering in the public interest
	7. Be fair and supportive to colleagues
	8. Practice lifelong learning and promote an ethical approach to the profession

What most codes have in common:
- Public interest is key (public good / public safety & welfare)
- The code presents fundamental principles
- Own judgement is expected
- Advice should be requested when unsure

- It is usually impossible/harmful for individuals to speak out against powerful corporations about not being ethical
