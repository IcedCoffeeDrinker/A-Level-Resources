# 12.5 Program Maintenance

Programs often have to be maintained to keep working as intended and to stay up-to-date with constantly changing customer needs.

There are three common types of maintenance.

## Corrective Maintenance
- Unfixed errors will often be discovered way past the initial release in rarely used parts of the code
	- new errors have to be patched regularly

## Adaptive Maintenance
- The program might be changed or augmented to stay relevant to the customers
- Adapt to specification changes, e.g. changing external APIs

## Perfective Maintenance
- Program fulfills all needs but is further improved
	- e.g. more effective algorithm or faster loading speed

## Write Maintainable Code
- Use Indentation
- Use descriptive names for variables and subroutines
- write comments explaining and defining sections of code
- comment on any unusual practices you implement
