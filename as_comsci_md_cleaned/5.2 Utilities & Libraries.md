# 5.2 Utilities & Libraries

## Utility Software
- analyzes, configures, optimizes, or maintains the system
- can be called by other software or the OS
- might come with the OS or is installed later

Tasks invole e.g.: encryption, compression, anti-maleware, etc.

### Book example: Hard Disk Formatter and Checker
- formatting (clearing) a disk
- setting up the file system and pointers (table of contents)
- partitioning the disk
- disk repair -> mark 'bad sectors' and recover data

### Hard Disk Defragmenter
- reorganizes files so that data from the same file is closer
    - -> faster to access
- defragmentation means making the data for each file more continuous and less spread out
- becomes impossible if disk is too full

### Backup Utility:
- schedule backups
- create backups only on changes

## Program Libraries
=> contain many little programs that are used as reliable subrotines
- helpful as the coder doesn't have to build everything from scratch

### Linking Libraries to Code:

#### Embed libraryies in source code
- libraries are added to the source code and compiled alongside it
    - -> likely results in many copies of same libraries in memory

#### Dynamic Linked Libraries (DLL)
- The library is separate from the compiled source code
- It's loaded into memory and executed by refferences in the code
- Many programs can use the same library simultaneously
    - + less storage & memory required
    - + easy to update libraries
- programs are dependent on external library
    - -> version errors, etc.
