# 10.3 Text Files

> Text Files play the significant role of storing data past the point where the program stops

All syntax on how to read, edit, and append is on Notion.

## End-OF-File / End-OF-Line Marker

example.txt:
```
Hello, this is the first line EOL-Marker
This is another line EOL-Marker
This will be the last line EOL-Marker
EOF-Marker
```

```
OPENFILE "test.txt" FOR READ
WHILE NOT EOF("test.txt") DO
    ...
```
> The EOF() function checks if the cursor inside test.txt has already reached the EOF marker

> It's better to use pre-condition loops instead of post-condition loops as the file might be empty and the EOF marker is reached immediately
