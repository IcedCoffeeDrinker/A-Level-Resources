# The Internet

# Difference between ‘World Wide Web’ and Internet

- Internet: A world wide collection of networks that use the Internet Protocol Suite (TCP/IP)
- The World Wide Web (WWW) is a collection of webpages hosted on web servers with the HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol)
    - The WWW = collection of resources hosted on the Internet
    - The Internet = collection of hardware connected up with protocols

# World Wide Web

- Web resources can be accessed through URLs
    - When typing ‘www.’ you specify that you want to access a web server
    - http://www.domain.com/folder/file
- Websites have sub-pages called ‘web pages’
    - web pages can contain hyperlinks that forward to other web pages

# Internet

- The internet was never designed as a whole but rather developed over time

## Internet Service Provider (ISP)

- ISPs are companies that provide parts of the Internet’s infrastructure
- The infrastructure of the Internet mainly consists of ISPs
- there is no agreed standard, but there is a hirachical standard to ISPs:
    - **access ISPs**: enable connections to the client (e.g. fibre optics in the streets)
    - **middle tier / regional ISPs**: connect multiple access ISPs
    - **Tier 1 / backbone ISPs**: connect regional ISPs; connected globally to other Tier 1 ISPs

## Routers - the larger ones

- The Internet is a mesh of cables with nodes at its intersections
- At each node there is a router that decides the best path for the received data
- Routers make sure data doesn’t get send where it’s not needed, preventing any conggestions that might negatively impact innocent bystanders

# IP addresses

- There are local and public IP addresses
- Public IP addresses are unique world wide, local IP addresses are not
- Local IP addresses are any IP addresses used inside a LAN. They are not necessarily private IP addresses, which are also exclusively used in private networks, as Local IP addresses, unlike private IP addresses, can also refer to [localhost](http://localhost) addresses, and more…
- IP addresses partially code for their geographic location
- Routers use the destination IP address to identify where packages have to be sent. The Geographical coding gives a sense of direction

# Packet switching

- Data is split into packets which don’t follow a fixed path → packets can go many different ways and reassemble at the destination
- Packet Structure:
    - Header
        - packet number (which packet in a sequence of packets)
        - MAC and IP address
        - Which protocol is being used
    - Data
    - Trailer
        - checksum = an algorithm that validates all data has been transmitted accurately

# Cloud Computing

- provides computing services on servers accessible through the Internet
- There are two options companies can choose for cloud computing / storage:
    - **Private cloud:** (three options)
        - An on-site cloud fully maintained by the own company
        - An on-site cloud that is created and maintained by a third-party company
        - A server is created and maintained by a third party and accessible through the Internet → is not necessarily owned but dedicated to a single company
    - **public cloud**
        - created, managed, and owned by a third-party ‘cloud service provider’
        - services provided can be categorized as 
        infrastructure provision, platform provision, software provision

## Benefits & Negatives of Cloud Computing

**Benefits**

- Flexible resources
- Better security
- No server maintenance
- Better data recovery
- less tech knowledge required → outsourcing

**Negatives (public cloud only)**

- Company cannot be sure that data doesn’t get shared with third-parties
- All of the company’s processes all heavily rely on a third party

# Streaming

- A continuous stream of data from a server to a client
- Data is sent in a compressed form to the client who needs software e.g. a player to decompress and make use of the data
- Data usually gets buffered to create a more stable stream
- Challenges:
    - Slow connections
    - Slow End-devices / old tech has trouble streaming

## Bit Stream & Byte Stream

- On devices data is stored as bytes → sending those bytes one after another is a byte stream
- A byte stream is compressed into a bit stream (of single bits) as bytes usually include a lot of empty / unused spaces
    - This is done because file-size is crucial for a good streaming experience
    - Bit stream is a standard for streaming, byte streams are not
- Two categories of streaming:
    - live / realtime e.g. Twitch
    - Viewing or Listening on demand e.g. Spotify / YouTube
- The quality of the data (e.g. 720p vs 1080p video) is determined by the bit rate

## Buffering

- To compensate for a varying bit rate, data gets buffered before it’s played:
    - The buffer acts as a storage tank with a fixed size. It has a low- and high watermark that are monitored by the media player. The bite stream has to come in at a higher rate than it is consumed, though the buffer should never run full.

# Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN)

- originally designed to handle calls, but also used for data transmission through modems
    - modems would convert between digital and analog signal
- often referred to as POTS (Plain Old Telephone Service)
- ISPs often provided cooperations with leased lines that allowed each company to have their personal WAN
    - Leased lines allowed for guaranteed connection and stable speeds
- There is also a Wireless Telephone Network that uses the internet as a medium: mobile phone companies act as access ISPs
