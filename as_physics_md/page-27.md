2.  $$n_1 \sin \theta = n_2$$
    $$1.48 \sin \theta = 1$$
    $$\theta = \sin^{-1}(\frac{1}{1.48}) \approx 42.5^{\circ}$$

    b) i: $$n = \frac{C}{v} = \frac{3.00 \times 10^8}{1.96 \times 10^8} = 1.53$$
    ii: $$\theta = \sin^{-1}(\frac{1}{1.53}) \approx 40.8^{\circ}$$
6.  
    a) A beam of unpolarized light consists of many individual photons that are momentarily plane polarized in many random directions.
    b) Reflections are strongly horizontally plane polarized, and this 'glare' can be gotten rid of by vertically plane polarizing the light.
    c) They're longitudinal waves which can't be polarized.
7.  
    a) $$n_1 \sin \theta_1 = n_2 \sin \theta_2$$
    $$\frac{\sin \theta_1}{\sin \theta_2} = n_2$$
    $$n_2 = \frac{\sin 48^{\circ}}{\sin 30^{\circ}} \approx 1.45 \approx 1.5$$
    b) i: The student has reached the critical angle at which total internal reflection occurs. This confirms that the refraction index of the glass must be larger than that of air.
    ii: $$n_2 \sin \theta_c = n_1$$
    $$1.49 \sin \theta_c = 1$$
    $$\theta_c = \sin^{-1}(\frac{1}{1.49}) \approx 42.2^{\circ} \approx 42^{\circ}$$ haha
8.  
    a) $$n_1 = \frac{3.00 \times 10^8}{1.56 \times 10^8} \approx 1.53$$
    $$n_2 = \frac{3.00 \times 10^8}{2.03 \times 10^8} \approx 1.48$$
    $$\theta_c = \sin^{-1}(\frac{1.48}{1.53}) \approx 75.3^{\circ}$$
    b) It is going to be reflected at 60° to the normal, as it's past the critical angle.
    c) Glare increases with a larger angle of incidence. Due to the light source being at the top, the angle of incidence will increase (relative to the normal) the lower you get. ?
9.  
    a) refraction

    c) i: The critical angle describes the angle of incidence at which the angle of refraction is 90° to the normal, just before total internal reflection occurs.
    ii: $$n_1 \sin \theta_c = n_2$$
    $$\theta_c = \sin^{-1}(\frac{n_2}{n_1}) = \sin^{-1}(\frac{1}{1.3}) \approx 50^{\circ}$$
    d) $$v = f \lambda$$
    $$\lambda = \frac{v}{f} = \frac{2.2 \times 10^8}{4.2 \times 10^{14}} = 5.2 \times 10^{-7} m$$
10. Infrared experiences total internal reflection inside the optical fibre, under the condition that it entered rather parallel to the cable and the fibre doesn't have any steep turns. This is because optic fibre has a refraction index larger than air or cladding which is usually used in optic fibre cables. Therefore a critical angle exists, past which total internal reflection occurs. Applications are e.g. super-high-bandwidth data transmission cables, as many different frequencies can be used simultaneously to send signals.
