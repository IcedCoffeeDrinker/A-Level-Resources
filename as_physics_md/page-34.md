## 7.2 Electrical Energy Transfer

### Voltage
- => Also known as "Potential Difference", describes the energy transfered per unit charge
$$
V = \frac{E}{Q}
$$
- V = Voltage (V)
- E = energy transfered (J)
- Q = Coulombs (C)

- Voltage is used for a theoretical transfer of energy, for actual energy transfered e.g. in circuits, potential difference is used.

### Potential Difference
Voltage accross electrical components that actually do work is refered to as "potential difference", or "pd"
$$
V = \frac{W}{Q}
$$
- V = Voltage (V)
- W = Work (J)
- Q = Coulombs

basically the same as for, volts

### Electromotive Force
- => (emf) is the energy supplied per unit charge
- => not a force! Describes a supply voltage, e.g. of a battery that provides a circuit with energy
- => often refered to as "emf"
$$
\varepsilon = \frac{E}{Q}
$$
- Îµ = emf (V)
- E = energy provided (J)
- Q = charge passing (C)

### Electron Volt
- => Describes a tiny amount of energy equal to the energy a single electron gains when being accelerated through a potential difference of 1 volt

*(Diagram showing an electron 'e' moving across a potential difference of 1V)*
$$
V = \frac{E}{Q}
$$
$$
E = QV = 1.602 \times 10^{-19} \times 1 J
$$
$$
E = 1.602 \times 10^{-19} J
$$
$$
1eV = 1.602 \times 10^{-19} J
$$

### Potential Difference vs Electromotive Force
- Pd voltage: for energy taken out of the system
- Emf voltage: for energy that is put into the system

### Terminal Voltage
- => Batteries usually have some internal resistance

*(Diagram of a circuit. An external resistor is shown with 1.3V across it. This is connected to a box labeled "Battery". Inside the battery box, there is a voltage source labeled "1.5V (emf)" in series with a resistor labeled "internal resistance" which has a voltage drop of "0.2V" across it. The output from the battery box is labeled "1.3V (Terminal Voltage)".)*

### Voltmeters & Ammeters
- Voltmeters have infinite resistance
- Ammeters have negligible resistance
(The rest you know)

1.  Potential difference describes the drop of voltage over components in the circuit, while the emf refers to the increase in voltage over e.g. a battery.

2.  a)
    $$
    \varepsilon = \frac{E}{Q} = \frac{120}{76} = 1.6 \text{ V}
    $$
    b)
    $$
    \Delta Q = I \cdot \Delta t = 2.4 \cdot 5.4 = 12.96 \text{ C}
    $$
    $$
    V = \frac{E}{Q} = \frac{120}{12.96} \approx 9.3 \text{ V}
    $$

3.  a)
    $$
    \frac{3.6 \times 10^{-19}}{1.602 \times 10^{-19}} \approx 6.0 \text{ eV}
    $$
    b)
    $$
    4.8 \times 10^6 \cdot 1.602 \times 10^{-19} = 7.7 \times 10^{-13} \text{ J}
    $$

4.  Usually there is only one type of charge carrier.
