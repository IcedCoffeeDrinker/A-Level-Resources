# 5.2 Types of Waves

## Longitudinal Waves
- Displacement is parallel to wave's movement
- (Diagram showing areas of rarefaction and compression)
    - rarefaction
    - compression

## Transverse Waves
- Displacement is perpendicular to wave's movement
- (Diagram showing a sinusoidal wave shape)
    - displacement

## Surface Waves
- Involve a combination of transverse and longitudinal waves
- particles spiral
- e.g. water (surface) waves
- (Diagram showing particles moving in a circular/spiral path)
    - displacement

## Graphing Longitudinal Waves
(Diagrams showing a representation of a longitudinal wave, followed by a pressure vs. distance graph and a displacement vs. distance graph)

## Transitioning between Media
(Diagram showing a wave passing from Medium 1 to Medium 2)

**Medium 1** | **Medium 2**
---|---

- In Medium 1: wavelength $$\lambda_1$$, speed $$v_1$$
- In Medium 2: wavelength $$\lambda_2$$, speed $$v_2$$

$$v_1 > v_2$$, therefore $$\lambda_1 > \lambda_2$$, but $$f_1 = f_2$$

> When transitioning into another medium, the wave speed and wavelength change, the frequency stays the same!

1.  A=0.5cm $$\lambda$$=4cm
2.  a) Because it causes displacement in the medium that is perpendicular to direction of the wave's movement
    b) Seismic waves are longitudinal waves, meaning that the displacement occurs in the direction of motion.
3.  The displacement is higher, causing more movement inside our ear. Higher displacement means larger differences in pressure, as shown in fig. G.
