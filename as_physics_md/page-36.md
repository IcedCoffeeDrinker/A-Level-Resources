# 7.4 Resistivity
=> A fundamental property to each material, describing its tendency to resist the flow of current.

*   denoted by symbol $\rho$
*   unit: $\Omega m$
*   $\rho$ describes the resistance which current experiences when flowing through 1m$^3$ of the material

$$
R = \frac{\rho l}{A}
$$

*   R $\equiv$ Resistance ($\Omega$)
*   $\rho \equiv$ resistivity of material ($\Omega m$)
*   A $\equiv$ area of crossection ($m^2$)
*   l $\equiv$ length of conductor (m)

- Resistivity is highly dependent on a material's density and temperature.
