# 7.8 Electric Circuit Laws

## Kirchhoffs Current Law
=> The current entering a junction must equal the current leaving the junction.

Or: the sum of current at a junction is zero.

$$
\sum I = 0
$$
$$
I_1 + I_2 + I_3 = I_4 + I_5
$$

-> This applies to any point in the circuit actually
=> charge entering = charge leaving

## Kirchhoff's Voltage Law
- The sum of the emfs in a closed loop is equal to the sum of the potential differences in that closed loop.

$$
\sum \mathcal{E} = \sum V
$$
ε = emf (V)
V = potential difference (V)

$$
\sum \mathcal{E} = \sum (IR)
$$
as V=IR

$$
\sum \Delta V = 0
$$
The net work done by the electric field on the charges must add up to zero in a closed loop.

**loop 1**
$$
emf = pd3 + pd2
$$

**loop 2**
$$
emf = pd3 + pd1
$$

1.  $$V=IR$$
    $$I = \frac{V}{R} = \frac{4.5}{5} = 0.9 A$$ ✓

2.  $$1.35 - 0.45 - 0.9 = 0$$ ✓

3.  Net work done by electric field must be zero for a closed loop.
    $$4.5 - 5 \cdot 0.9 = 0$$ ✓
    $$
    \sum \Delta V = 0
    $$

4.  $$E_{net} = V_{net} = IR = 0.38 \cdot (10+20) = 11.4V$$ ✓
