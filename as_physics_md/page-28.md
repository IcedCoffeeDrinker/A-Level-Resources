# 6.1 Wave-Particle Duality

## Huygens' Principle
=> infinite points on a wavefront are treated as wave sources that form the next wavefront.

[Diagram showing Huygens' principle with wavelets forming a new wavefront]

- points constructively and destructively interfere to form another wavefront.
- This model explains refraction and diffraction
	- e.g. no sources at the edges to cancel spreading waves = diffraction

*isn't exclusive to e.m. radiation*

## Wave-Particle Duality
=> Electromagnetic radiation (photons) can act as waves and as particles under certain circumstances.

### Quantisation:
=> Energy can only exist in certain increments in our universe, the concept of such steps is called quantization.
- particle-like behaviour of electromagnetic waves can be explained by quantisation:
	- in place of the wave there are moving energy packets (photons) with energy proportional to that of the wave

### Calculate Photon Energy:
*photons have no mass or charge*
$$E=hf$$
- **E** = energy of photon (J)
- **h** = planck's constant (J·s) $$ \approx 6.63 \times 10^{-34} \text{ J}\cdot\text{s}$$
- **f** = frequency of electromagnetic wave (Hz)

**Planck's constant:** smallest possible increment for energy in the universe.

### Evidence that electromagnetic radiation is...

#### a wave:
- interference
- diffraction
- polarization
	- *only waves can be polarized*

#### a particle:
- photoelectric effect
- *particles cannot superpose to a constant pattern*

## Electron Wave-Particle-Duality
=> If electrons move at very high speeds they act as waves
- at high speeds electrons interfere and diffract
	- they can even form an interference pattern

### Evidence that electrons are...

#### waves:
- diffraction and interference at high speeds

#### particles:
- when ionizing atoms (changing its charge) the charge changes in steps
	- => must be quantisation which hints to packets of energy
	- = particles

1.  a) Interference pattern caused by a double slit when unobserved. ✔️
    
    b) Very fast traveling electrons passing through a double slit will also produce an interference pattern when not observing the slits. ✔️

2.  $$v = f \cdot \lambda$$
    $$f = \frac{v}{\lambda} = \frac{3 \times 10^8}{2 \times 10^{-7}} = 1.5 \times 10^{15} \text{ Hz}$$
    $$E = h \cdot f = 6.63 \times 10^{-34} \cdot 1.5 \times 10^{15} \approx 9.95 \times 10^{-19} \text{ J}$$
    ✔️
    
3.  Only waves can be polarized, meaning that electrons would act as a wave under those circumstances. But this doesn't mean that it cannot also act as particles. Light e.g. might be polarized sometimes, but under certain circumstances it acts as particles, the same counts for electrons. ✔️
    
4.  Light can show properties of a wave and of a particle, depending on the circumstances. It would be wrong to say that it's exclusively one of both. ✔️

5.  [Diagram showing diffraction of waves around a circular obstacle] ✔️
    - very detailed, less sources and only wavefronts next to and after the obstacle would be enough
    - no waves to negatively interfere with at the edges -> diffraction occurs
