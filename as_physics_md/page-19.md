# Exam Practice

1.  B ✓
2.  $$v=f\lambda$$
    $$f = \frac{v}{\lambda} = \frac{2.8}{4.4} \approx 0.64$$
    D ✓
3.  A ✓
4.  $$1500 \cdot 0.87 \cdot \frac{1}{2} = 652.5 \text{ A}$$ ✓
5.  a) Some energy got transformed into e.g. heat. ✓
    b) $$50\mu s \cdot 5900 \cdot \frac{1}{2}$$
    $$50 \times 10^{-6} \cdot 5900 \cdot \frac{1}{2} = 0.1475m \approx 0.15m$$ ✓
6.  a) Sound waves travel through the air as longitudinal pressure waves. Atoms are bumping into each other and forming areas of compression and rarefaction. ✓
    b) The frequency refers to completed cycles per second. ✓
    c) $$v = f\lambda = 2 \cdot 1500 = 3.0 \times 10^3 ms^{-1}$$ ✓
    d) The primary wave moves faster than the more powerful secondary wave, which probably caused the wave. Also waves travel faster through solids, so the wave might have been noticeable through the ground. ✓
7.  $$343 \text{ ms}^{-1} \quad f = 55.8 \text{ MHz}$$
    $$\lambda = \frac{v}{f} = \frac{\cancel{343}}{55800 \times 10^3} = 5.38 \times 10^{-3}$$
    use speed of light ($$3 \times 10^8$$) ✓
8.  a)
    i. Frequencies are higher than what the human ear can detect. ✓
    ii. $$s=vt = 1500 \cdot 1.6 \times 10^{-4} = 0.24m$$
    $$\frac{0.24}{2} = 0.12$$
    iii. Because one measures only the start of a pulse, sending more would waste energy and wouldn't allow for a second measurement. Pulse must return before next is sent. ✓
    b)
    i. They can cause cancer by altering one's DNA ✓
    ii. 
        - **X-rays are:**
            - an electromagnetic wave ✓
            - significantly faster (speed of light in medium)
        - **Ultrasound is:**
            - a mechanical wave ✓
            - rather slow (speed of sound in medium) ✓
9.  a) The reflected waves will have flipped amplitude & that are also a bit smaller, as some energy was dissipated into the plate. ✓
    b)
    i. ~~The phases of both waves must be perfectly overlapping at the microphone~~ There is only one microphone
    ii. ~~Put the plate directly to the microphone and slowly put it back until both waves perfectly overlap. The distance between the plate and the microphone is wavelength * 1.5~~ add second mic lol
    iii. Previous question too vague, I now understand...
        - Remove the metal plate to prevent any reflections, add a second microphone and connect it to one input on the oscilloscope. ✓
        - Put both microphones together directly and move one back slowly until both waves overlap perfectly again. ✓
        - Distance between microphones = $$\lambda$$ (= 1m example)
        - Speed of sound = $$343ms^{-1}$$
        - $$f = \frac{v}{\lambda} = \frac{343}{1m} = 343 Hz$$
        - $$\lambda = \text{measured value}$$
        - $$f = \text{known value}$$
        - $$v = f \cdot \lambda = \dots$$
