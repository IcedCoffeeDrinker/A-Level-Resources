# 7.6 Semiconductors

## Semiconductors - Atomic Structure
**Silicon Atom**
- Four free spots in the outer shell
- Four corners -> Triangular Mesh

## Conductivity of silicone
**Silicon Atom**
- shared electrons from neighbours -> full
- -> no free electrons

**Iron Atom**
- single valence electron
- -> no strong connection
- -> can move freely

## Energy Bands
- Energy levels of single atoms can superpose with the ones from atoms in close proximity
  > This results of bands that contain many similar but specific energy levels
  > Those bands exist throughout the entire conductor
- The two outer bands are:
  - **valence band**: electrons still stuck to their atoms
  - **conduction band**: electrons can move freely through the lattice
