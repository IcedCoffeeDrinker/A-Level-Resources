### a)
I would use a long piece of wire made out of the metal, which should be as pure as possible.
I would measure:
- initial length
- mean of the diameter from three positions
- The weight of my hook for the weights

The setup would be as follows:
- Clamp down the wire at the short side of the table
- Run the wire over the table and over a pully
- put a paper mark on the wire and align a fixed ruler with it
- Place the hook onto the wire

The experiment is executed as follows
- ensure the flag aligns with zero on the ruler
- add a 100g mass and note down the weigh (mass * 9.81)
- measure the displacement of the flag and note it down
- Repeat

Use the data:
- Plot the mass on the y-axis and the strain on the x-axis
> use vernier scale and use a micrometer to determine the diameter
- Determine the slope before the limit of proportionality
- calculate the Young Modulus as follows:
$$E = \frac{\sigma}{\epsilon} = \frac{F l_i}{A \Delta l} = \frac{m}{\Delta l} \cdot \frac{g l_i}{A}$$
$$E(\text{Pa}) = \text{gradient} \cdot \frac{g l_i}{A}$$
$$ \text{where } A = \pi (\frac{D}{2})^2 $$

### b)
I would put a drop-box below the weights (+ wear glasses for eye protection)

### c)
I would repeat the experiment twice, as inaccuracies will become less significant

### a)
The spring obeys hook's law, as the length of the spring, or more specifically its change in length is proportional (in a linear relation) to the force applied.
> k, the gradient stays constant

### b)
$$ k = \frac{\Delta F}{\Delta x} = \frac{1.6}{0.1} = 16 \text{Nm}^{-1} \approx 20 \text{Nm}^{-1} $$

### c)
#### i)
$$ 0.41 - 0.09 = 0.32 \text{m} $$
$$ \Delta x = 0.32 \text{m} \quad k = 20 \text{Nm}^{-1} \quad F = ? $$
$$ F = k \Delta x $$
$$ F = 20 \cdot 0.32 = 6.4 \text{N} $$
> They want you to use $16 \text{Nm}^{-1}$
$$ PE_{el} = \frac{1}{2} F \cdot \Delta x $$

#### ii)
$$ PE_{el} = \frac{1}{2} \cdot 6.4 \cdot 0.32 \approx 1 \text{N} $$

### d)
As the spring is compressed even more, it stores ever more Potential elastic energy. When the cann is opened, all that elastic energy is converted into kinetic energy, therefore the speed will be slightly higher.

# 8.
### a)
$$ F_T = F_D $$
$$ W = F_U $$
- $F_T$ = Thrust
- $F_D$ = Drag _viscous drag_
- $W$ = Weight
- $F_U$ = Upthrust

### b)
$$ W = F_U $$
$$ W = V \cdot \rho \cdot g $$
$$ W = 7100 \cdot 1030 \cdot 9.81 \approx 7.2 \times 10^7 \approx 7 \times 10^7 \text{N} $$

### c)
#### i)
It means that the submarine slightly decreases in size as it gets compressed by the deeper water.

#### ii)
The weight should also be decreased, as $W=V\rho g$ has to stay true. -> Pump out water

#### iii)
A much smaller Young Modulus means a lot less stiffness. High stiffness is required to hold up against the pressure from outside. -> else yield point might be exceeded.

### a)
$$ \Delta F = k \Delta x $$
$$ k = \frac{\Delta F}{\Delta x} $$
$$ k = \frac{7.9}{0.008} = 987.5 \text{Nm}^{-1} \approx 1000 \text{Nm}^{-1} $$

### b)
$$ \Delta x = 0.063 - 0.016 = 0.047 \text{m} \quad k = 1000 \text{Nm}^{-1} $$
$$ EP_{el} = \frac{1}{2} k x^2 $$
$$ EP_{el} = \frac{1}{2} \cdot 1000 \cdot 0.047^2 \approx 1.1 \text{J} \approx 1 \text{J} $$

### c)
#### i)
$$ EP_{el} = KE \quad KE = \frac{1}{2} m v^2 $$
$$ 1 = \frac{1}{2} \cdot 0.0094 \cdot v^2 $$
$$ 1 = 0.0047 v^2 $$
$$ v^2 = 212.77 $$
$$ v = 14.6 \text{ms}^{-1} \approx 15 \text{ms}^{-1} $$
> forgot vertical movement

#### ii)
There is no air resistance.
The spring doesn't 'produce' thermal energy

### d)
#### i)
$$ \Delta x = v \cdot t $$
$$ 3 = 15 \cdot t $$
$$ t = 0.2 \text{s} $$
$$ v_{fy} = v_{iy}^0 + at $$
$$ v_{fy} = 9.81 \cdot 0.2 = 1.962 \text{ms}^{-1} $$
$$ C = \sqrt{a^2 + b^2} = \sqrt{15^2 + 1.962^2} \approx 15.1 \text{ms}^{-1} $$
> forgot angle

#### ii)
$$ \Delta y = v_{iy} t^0 + \frac{1}{2} at^2 $$
$$ \Delta y = \frac{1}{2} \cdot 9.81 \cdot 0.2^2 \approx 0.196 \text{m} $$
$$ 0.196 + 0.03 = 0.226 \text{m} $$
$$ 0.196 - 0.03 = 0.166 \text{m} $$
$$ 0.226 \text{m} > 0.2 \text{m} > 0.166 \text{m} $$

### e)
A solid disk would fly at a slower speed with the same kinetic energy provided due to $EK = \frac{1}{2} m v^2$. Therefore the lighter disk flies faster.
