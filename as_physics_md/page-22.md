# 5.5 Diffraction
=> Spreading of wave energy through a gap or around an obstacle

## Diffraction Shadows
- Depending on the difference of the wavelength and obstacle size the wave might, or might not fully surround the object

## Diffraction Intensity
- Diffraction happens most when the gap size equals the wavelength
(Diagram showing a large gap with little diffraction and a gap equal to wavelength with lots of diffraction)

## Interference Pattern

### Single-Slit Interference
(Diagram showing wave passing through a single slit, creating a pattern of maxima and minima on a screen)

### Interference pattern orders
**maxima:**
(Diagram showing a central bright "zero order" fringe, with dimmer "1st order" and even dimmer "2nd order" fringes on either side)
**minima:**
(Diagram showing dark fringes between the maxima)

**Monochromatic light** is used, as it contains only one frequency (color) of electromagnetic waves

- **Huygen's Priciple**
  => Each wave front consists of an infinite amount of point wave sources
  - usually those sources interfere and add up back to the original wave
  - when removing the outer sources nothing will cancel the inner sources
    => the wave diffracts, spreads out
(Diagram illustrating Huygen's principle, with labels "add up + cancel to same wave", "wave spreads out", and "interference gets noticeable")
\* this only shows two points but actually there are infinite... I get u bro

(Diagram showing path difference for the first minimum in single-slit diffraction)
- must be destructive
- path difference must be $$ \frac{\lambda}{2} $$ (phase diff. of $$ \pi $$)

Ooh, but why do all points interfere destructively at the minima?
(Diagram showing pairing of wave sources within the slit)
There is a destructive partner for everyone
*poetic*

calculate maxima positions
two slits: $$ d\sin\theta = n\lambda $$
grating: $$ d\sin\theta = n\lambda $$
single slit: minima only? $$ d\sin\theta = m\lambda $$

## Diffraction Grating Formula
$$ n\lambda = d\sin\theta $$
- n = order of maxima
- λ = wavelength
- d = distance between gaps
- θ: angle between initial direction and maxima

$$ n\lambda = \text{path difference} $$
if $$ n\lambda = 1, 2, \text{etc} $$
=> maximum (constructive)
if $$ n\lambda = 0.5, 1.5, \text{etc} $$
=> minimum (destructive)

### θ visualization
(Diagrams visualizing the angle θ and the path difference)

## Experimentation
(Diagram of an experimental setup)
point source -> single-, double-slit, or grating -> at least 5m! to reduce error -> screen
maxima also known as 'fringes'

## Interference pattern same for obstacles
(Diagram showing interference pattern from a hair)
point source -> hair -> screen
exactly same thing as any slit experiment
e.g. single hair with d = width same as single slit with d = hole width

## Refraction
=> When a wave transitions into another medium it changes speed and therefore also slightly direction
=> change in direction only at an angle

## Diffraction
=> When a wave encounters a corner or squeezes through a gap it spreads out.

## Questions
1. Waves can diffract around the ship if they're large enough ✓

2. a) Diffraction occurs more for the first dish, as its size matches the wavelength. For the second dish the difference between wavelength and dish width must be large, as little refraction is occurring ✓
b) 1. might be used for broadcasting and 2. for satillite communicatio ✓ explanation...

3. 26.6° 30.1° 36.0°
$$ \frac{1}{1000 \times 10^3} = 10^{-6} \text{m} = d $$ ✓
$$ \lambda n = d\sin\theta \quad n=1 $$
$$ \lambda = \frac{d\sin\theta}{n} = 10^{-6}\sin\theta $$
26.6: $$ \lambda = 10^{-6}\sin 26.6 = 4.48 \times 10^{-7} \text{m} $$ ✓
30.1: $$ \lambda = 10^{-6}\sin 30.1 = 5.02 \times 10^{-7} \text{m} $$ ✓
36.0: $$ \lambda = 10^{-6}\sin 36.0 = 5.88 \times 10^{-7} \text{m} $$ ✓

4. $$ \lambda n = d\sin\theta $$
$$ n = \frac{d\sin\theta}{\lambda} = \frac{10^{-6}\sin(90^\circ)}{\lambda} $$
$$ \lambda = 4.48 \times 10^{-7} \implies n = 2.23 \text{ so } n=2 $$ ✓
$$ \lambda = 5.02 \times 10^{-7} \implies n = 1.99 \text{ so } n=1 $$ ✓
$$ \lambda = 5.88 \times 10^{-7} \implies n = 1.701 \text{ so } n=1 $$ ✓

### X-Ray
$$ \lambda = 1.51 \times 10^{-10} \quad n=2 \text{ at } 0.0867\text{m} $$
$$ \theta = \tan^{-1}\left(\frac{0.0867}{0.5}\right) \approx 9.84^\circ $$
$$ n\lambda = d\sin\theta $$
$$ d = \frac{n\lambda}{\sin\theta} = \frac{2 \cdot 1.51 \times 10^{-10}}{\sin(9.84)} = 1.77 \times 10^{-9} \text{m} $$ ✓

1. Coherent waves have a consistent phase relationship with each other. This requires them to have the same frequency, wavelength and travel at the same speed. ✓
2. a) 0 rad. ✓
   b) path difference = $$ \frac{\lambda}{2} $$ ✓
      phase difference = $$ \pi $$ rad. ✓
   c) path difference = $$ \lambda $$ ✓
      phase difference = $$ 2\pi $$ rad. ✓
   d) The pattern would show more maxima, be fainter but larger. -> stretched out (might -> other factors, $$ \sin\theta \le 1 $$) ✓
