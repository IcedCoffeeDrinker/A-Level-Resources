# 5.4 Stationary Waves
=> also known as standing wave

## Requirements:
- two waves traveling in opposite direction
- same speed
- same frequency
=> then they're **coherent**

note: actually the phase between both waves does change, but if one imagines one wave flipped, then the phase shift is constant

## Energy
- Standing waves don't transmit energy
- **Progressive waves** do transmit energy
	-↳ waves that 'move' in a direction

## Nodes
=> Points on the wave that allways perfectly cancel
- ↳ amplitude is always zero

## Antinodes
=> Points (lines) that experience the most variation in amplitude

## Modes
=> shape of the standing wave (number of nodes)

| shape | mode | wavelength (λ) |
|---|---|---|
| (single loop) | fundamental / 1st harmonic | $$= 2L$$ |
| (two loops) | 1st overtone / 2nd harmonic | $$= L$$ |
| (three loops) | 2nd overtone / 3rd harmonic | $$= \frac{2L}{3}$$ |
| (four loops) | 3rd overtone / 4th harmonic | $$= \frac{L}{2}$$ |

$$ \lambda = \frac{2L}{n} $$
n = # harmonic

## String Wave Speed
$$ v = \sqrt{\frac{T}{\mu}} $$
- v $$ \hat{=} $$ travel speed of wave (ms⁻¹)
- T $$ \hat{=} $$ tension in string (N)
- μ $$ \hat{=} $$ mass of string per meter (kgm⁻¹)

find frequency for standing wave:
$$ f = \frac{1}{\lambda} \cdot \sqrt{\frac{T}{\mu}} $$
where $$ \lambda = 2L, L, \frac{2}{3}L, ... $$

Note: fundamental frequency $$ \hat{=} f_0 $$

### 1. 
75cm = l, 2nd harmonic
v = 420ms⁻¹
$$ \lambda = 1 \times l = 0.75\text{m} $$ ✓
$$ v = \lambda \cdot f $$
$$ 420 = 0.75 \cdot f $$
$$ f = 560\text{Hz} $$ ✓

### 2. 
a) $$ T=90\text{N} \quad \mu = 4.8 \times 10^{-4} \text{kgm}^{-1} $$
$$ v = \sqrt{\frac{T}{\mu}} = \sqrt{\frac{90}{4.8 \times 10^{-4}}} = 400\text{ms}^{-1} $$ ✓
b) $$ l=0.74\text{m} $$
$$ f = \frac{v}{\lambda} $$
$$ f_0 = \frac{v}{2 \cdot 0.74} \quad \text{...} \quad 433 \implies 293 \approx 300\text{Hz} $$ ✓
*(Note: Handwritten calculation appears as `f_0 = 1/(2*0.74) * 433 = 293`)*

### 3. 
*(A graph is shown with Length (m) on the y-axis vs Frequency (Hz) on the x-axis, with several data points and a line of best fit)*

$$ f_0 \quad (0.7, 165) $$ closest point to the line
$$ l = 0.7\text{m} \quad f = 165\text{Hz} $$
$$ f_0 = \frac{1}{2l} \sqrt{\frac{T}{\mu}} $$
$$ 2 f_0 l = \sqrt{\frac{T}{\mu}} $$
$$ (2 f_0 l)^2 = \frac{T}{\mu} $$
$$ \mu = \frac{T}{4 f_0^2 l^2} = \frac{23.5}{4 \cdot 165^2 \cdot 0.7^2} = 4.4 \times 10^{-4} \text{kgm}^{-1} $$ ✓

### 4. 
$$ \mu = \frac{50}{4 \cdot 3000^2 \cdot 2^2} = 3.47 \times 10^{-5} \text{kgm}^{-1} $$
