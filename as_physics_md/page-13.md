# 4.2 Plan & Conduct Experiments

1.  **Formulate an Experimental Question:**
    -   What question will this experiment answer?
    -   Be clear and specific
    -   You should probably state dependent and independent variables

2.  **Define Experimental Variables**
    -   be clear about the type of variable you are using
    -   include all variables

    ### Independent Variables:
    -   the variables I determine, e.g. the load on a spring
    -   those variables are varied in steps to uncover their influence on other variables

    ### Dependent Variables:
    -   the variables I measure
    -   dependent variables depend on the values of the independent variables

    ### Control Variables:
    -   the variables which I keep constant
    -   such variables include any factors that might interfere or add unwanted complexity to our experiment, e.g. gravity
    -   This may include variables such as temperature or air moisture which I should record

3.  **Create a Data Table** (can be done after Step 4 also)
    -   for each measurement and value calculated a column
    -   for each variation in an independent variable a row
    -   Labels should include: name, symbol used and units

    **Example:**
    | Weight force $$F$$ (N) | Length $$l$$ (mm) | Extension $$x$$ (cm) |
    | ----------------------- | ----------------- | -------------------- |
    | 0.00                    | 50                | 0                    |
    | 0.58                    |                   |                      |
    | 2.13                    |                   |                      |
    | 2.98                    |                   |                      |

    ❗️ always also measure the independent variable
    *The weights might not be perfect (1N)*

4.  **Planning and Recording Apparatus Setup**
    -   Create a simple labeled sketch
    -   Use the correct terminology for describing the setup
    
    **Example:**
    *A sketch showing a stand with a clamp holding a spring. A weight is attached to the bottom of the spring. A ruler is placed next to the spring to measure its length.*

5.  **Safety Hazard Assessment**
    -   Following objects and conditions are considered hazardous:
        -   Voltages > 12V
        -   Large electric currents
        -   Temperatures > 40°C
        -   brittle/sharp materials
        -   flammable and reactive substances
        -   Toxic substances
        -   High pressure or large amounts of energy
    -   Create a table as follows to determine mitigations

    | Hazard                                         | Mitigation                                                       |
    | ---------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
    | - Heavy mass falling on people                 | - Place the apparatus on a stable workbench, clamp it to the bench |
    | - flying fragments (e.g. when spring breaks) | - wear safety glasses                                            |

6.  **Conducting the Experiment**
    -   follow a constant procedure to keep results constant
        -   ↳ both for setup and changing the independent variable
    -   Regularly measure control variables! e.g. temperature
    -   Create multiple data tables for each run (if you do multiple)
    -   also note faulty/unexpected measurements
        -   ↳ explain what happened in the foot notes
        -   ↳ don't introduce a bias

7.  **Identify Sources of Error**
    -   Determine what might have caused errors
    -   How can those errors be reduced?

8.  **Analyze and Interpret the Data**
    -   Draw graphs and find correlations
    -   Answer your research/experimental question
    -   differentiate between causation and correlation

## Note: Calculations
-   Note down formulae that you may need
-   Rearrange the formulae if needed

---

## Scientific Method Breakdown
1.  Make observation
2.  Create a model or hypothesis to predict future observations
3.  Test if the model holds true
4.  Observe the result
5.  Revise the model or hypothesis
6.  Repeat if needed

### A scientific theory:
-   makes predictions
-   can be tested
-   can be falsified

## Accuracy and Precision

*[Image: A graph with "number of results" on the y-axis and "value" on the x-axis. A bell curve shows the distribution of results. A vertical line marks the "actual value". "Accuracy" is shown as the horizontal distance between the peak of the bell curve and the "actual value". "Precision" is indicated by the width of the bell curve.]*

**Accuracy:** How close are my results to the correct value?

**Precision:** How often will I get the same result when measuring? what is the spread (random error)?
