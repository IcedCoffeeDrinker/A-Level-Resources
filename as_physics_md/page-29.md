# 6.2 Photoelectric Effect
=> Showed how under certain circumstances light will exclusively act as particles

## Setup:
*Diagram annotations:*
- light
- photo electrons
- metal plate with negative charge
- vacuum chamber
- gold plate
- gold leaf electroscope

### Photoelectric effect:
- when shining light above a certain frequency onto a metal, it releases electrons (called 'photoelectrons')

## How it works:
- light travels as photons, their energy is proportional to their frequency
- a photon collides with the electron
    - the photon's energy is greater or equal to the **work function** (= energy required to free the electron)
    => photon is 'used up' and the electron is released as a **photoelectron**

## Creation of Photoelectrons
- **photoelectrons** = electrons released due to interaction with a photon
- **work function** => $\phi$ = minimum energy required to free an electron from the surface of a material (not the atom!)
- **threshold frequency** = frequency at which one photon carries energy equal to the work function

### Atomic Interaction
- photon collides with electron
- if photon energy >= work function -> electron probably released
- if photon energy < work function -> photon continues its journey

## Model expectations
### Light as Wave
- any frequency will remove the metal's charge with enough time and intensity
  => wrong
- more intense (brighter) light will provide the released electrons with more energy so they will be faster
  => wrong

### Light as Particle
- only certain frequencies provide photons with sufficient energy to create a photoelectron on a collision
  => correct
- more photons will cause more photoelectrons to be emitted due to more collisions
  => correct

## Photoelectric Effect Equation
=> Determine the energy and speed of photoelectrons
$$
\frac{1}{2}mv_{max}^2 = hf - \phi
$$
final energy = photon energy - energy for freeing the electron

- $m$ = mass of electron (kg)
- $v_{max}$ = maximum possible speed of electron (ms⁻¹)
- $h$ = Planck's Constant (Js)
- $f$ = frequency of el. mag. wave (Hz)
- $\phi$ = work function (J)

## Stopping Voltage
=> The voltage of the electric field required to prevent electrons from freeing while under a certain frequency of electromagnetic radiation
$$
\frac{1}{2}mv_{max}^2 = e \cdot V_s
$$
- $e$ = single electron charge (C)
- $V_s$ = stopping voltage (V)

## Photoelectric Cell Experiment
*Diagram annotations:*
- electrons caught
- voltmeter
- ammeter
- battery (variable)
- light
- photoelectrons
- plate

- increase the voltage of the battery until no electrons are able to detach from the plate
  => Ammeter shows zero
  => voltmeter shows 'stopping voltage'

## Graphing Photoelectron Energy vs. Frequency
*Graph features:*
- **y-axis:** Photoelectron energy ($\frac{1}{2}mv_{max}^2$)
- **x-axis:** frequency (f)
- **y-intercept:** -work function ($-\phi$)
- **x-intercept:** threshold frequency
- **slope:** m = Planck's constant (h)
$$
\frac{1}{2}mv_{max}^2 = hf - \phi
$$
$$
y = m \cdot x + b
$$

Also calculate work function with x-intercept:
$$
\frac{1}{2}mv_{max}^2 = hf - \phi
$$
$$
0 = hf - \phi
$$
$$
\phi = hf
$$

## Questions
1. $$ \frac{3.68 \times 10^{-15}}{1.602 \times 10^{-15}} \approx 2.30 \text{ eV} $$
2. a) red light has a too long frequency, so the photons won't have enough energy to free the electrons. Photon's energy is proportional to the frequency so under the threshold frequency the energy of the photon won't exceed the working function.
