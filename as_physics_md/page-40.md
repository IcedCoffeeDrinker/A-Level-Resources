# 7.7 Series & Parallel Circuits

## Conservation of Current
=> Throughout the entire circuit current stays conserved

## Current
### Series:
same same same
`---[ R ]---[ R ]---[ R ]---`

### Parallel:
(Diagram shows a 10Ω resistor with current I₁ in parallel with a 20Ω resistor with current I₂)
$$I_1 = 2 \times I_2$$
=> The current flowing through a resistor in a parallel circuit is inversely proportional to the resistance

## Voltage
### Series:
(Diagram shows two resistors in series with a 3V drop across the first and a 2V drop across the second)

### Parallel:
(Diagram shows two resistors in parallel with 5V across both)
always the same for both

## Resistance
### Series:
(Diagram shows R₁=10Ω in series with R₂=20Ω)
$$R_{total} = R_1 + R_2$$
$$= 10 + 20 = 30\Omega$$

### Parallel:
(Diagram shows R₁=10Ω in parallel with R₂=20Ω)
$$R_{total} = \frac{1}{\frac{1}{R_1} + \frac{1}{R_2}}$$
$$= \frac{1}{\frac{1}{10} + \frac{1}{20}} \approx 6.67\Omega$$

1.  The charge stays the same at every point in a series circuit ✓
2.  $$1.5 + 4.5 + 3 + 3 = 6 + 6 = 12V$$ ✓
3.  $$V=IR$$
    $$I = \frac{V}{R} = \frac{6}{24} = \frac{1}{4}A$$ ✓
4.  $$V=IR = 0.12 \cdot 100 = 12V$$
    $$0.24 \cdot 50 = 12V$$ ✓
5.  $$R = 1000\left(100 + \frac{1}{\frac{1}{100} + \frac{1}{100}}\right) = 150k\Omega$$
    $$V=IR$$
    $$I = \frac{V}{R} = \frac{230}{150000} = 1.5 \times 10^{-3} A$$ ✓
6.  a) $$R_{total} = 8\Omega \quad I = \frac{240}{8} = 30A$$ ✓
    b) $$I = \frac{V}{R} = \frac{240}{48} = 5A$$ ✓
