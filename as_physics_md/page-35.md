# 7.3 Current-Voltage Relationship

## emf-current relationship
- the emf pushes electrons through the electric force
- a higher emf voltage results in a stronger electric force
	- ↳ electrons move faster
	- ↳ the current is higher

$$I \propto V$$ (usually)

## Ohm's Law
$$R = \frac{V}{I}$$
- R = resistance ($\Omega$)
- V = voltage (V)
- I = current (A)

## Ohmic Conductor
Conductors for which Ohm's law applies:
- ↳ the current is proportional to the voltage across the conductor
- ↳ provided the temperature stays constant

## Temperature and Resistance
- → Increased temperature reduces the conductivity
	- ↳ resistance increases

## Graph Relationship - Ohm's Law
standard ohmic relationship
$$m = \frac{1}{\Omega}$$

## Filament Bulb
- non-ohmic
- at high currents the bulb heats up and resistance increases
	- ↳ less current

## Diode (e.g. LED)
- A diode only allows current to pass in one direction
- A threshold voltage has to be passed first
	- ↳ then there is little resistance
- threshold frequency

## Thermistor
- Aka thermal resistor reduces its resistance at high temperatures
- many semiconductors become less resistive at higher temperatures

## Questions
1. $$V = I \cdot R$$ The voltage across two points is proportional to the current flowing between them.

2. $$V = IR$$
   $$R = \frac{V}{I} = \frac{6}{0.05} = 120\Omega$$

3. The ohm's law only applies for the ohmic conductor, the non-ohmic conductor will show behaviour where $$V \propto I$$ isn't the case.

4. Because the slope would equal to the resistance, when pd is on the y.

5. Component a has higher resistance as $$m = \frac{1}{\Omega}$$, meaning a less steep slope indicates higher resistance.
