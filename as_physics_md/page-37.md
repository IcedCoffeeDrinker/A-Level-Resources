# 7.5 Conduction & Resistance

## Conduction
- conductors have free electrons in the outer layer of their atoms
  > -> electrons not required for bonding can move freely through the material
- electrons move thousands of kilometers a second in random directions at room temperature -> random thermal motion
- An electric field will create a tendency for the electrons to move to one direction
  > -> this average velocity is called drift velocity
  > -> the drift velocity usually is only milimeters per second

magnetic field
* magnetic field lines show the direction in which positive particles would move

drift velocity

## Transport Equation
$$ I = nAve $$
- I ≜ current (A)
- n ≜ number of electrons per m³ of material aka 'number density'
- A ≜ crossectional area of material (m²)
- v ≜ drift velocity (ms⁻¹)
- e ≜ electron charge (1.602x10⁻¹⁹ C)

(Diagram of a cylinder of conductor)
volume = Area x Δx
volume = Area x v x Δt
= AvΔt

$$ I = \frac{Q}{\Delta t} = \frac{n \times \text{volume} \cdot e}{\Delta t} = \frac{n \times Av\cancel{\Delta t} \times e}{\cancel{\Delta t}} $$

## Resistance - Atom Respective
- electrons experience high random motion, colliding with many atoms
  > -> this is resistance: creating a general drift of electrons through the lattice is difficult
- at high currents electrons collide more with atoms -> heat is produced
  > -> the heat then causes greater resistance

## Resistivity - Atom Perspective
- For most materials resistivity increases at higher temperatures due to increased collisions
- semiconductors have lower resistivity at higher temperatures
  > -> electrons require energy to move from the atom's valence band to the conduction band
  > -> more heat means more free electrons per m³
  > -> $$ I \uparrow = n \uparrow Ave $$

## Questions
1. The average velocity of electrons moving through the conductor.
2. 
   $$ I = nAve $$
   $$ v = \frac{I}{nAe} = \frac{2.2}{18.7 \times 10^{28} \left( \frac{(0.0004)^2 \pi}{4} \right) 1.602 \times 10^{-19}} $$
   $$ v = 6.0 \times 10^{-4} \text{ms}^{-1} $$
3. There are more atoms that the electrons can collide with.
4. 5.
   $$ V \cdot n = \frac{(0.02)^2}{4}\pi \cdot 0.002 \times 8.42 \times 10^{28} $$
   $$ \text{number of electrons} \approx 5.29 \times 10^2 $$
