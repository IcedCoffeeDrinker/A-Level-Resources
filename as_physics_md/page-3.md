## 2.1 Problems

1.  $$25m = \Delta h$$
    $$mgh = \frac{1}{2}mv^2$$
    $$v = \sqrt{2gh} = \sqrt{2 \cdot 9.81 \cdot 25} = 22.15 \text{ m/s}$$

2.  $$v = \sqrt{2gh} \quad \Delta h = 15m$$
    $$v = \sqrt{2 \cdot 9.81 \cdot 15} = 17.16 \text{ms}^{-1}$$

3.  $$v = \sqrt{2g\Delta h} = \sqrt{2 \cdot 9.81 \cdot 45} = 29.71 \text{ms}^{-1} \quad \Delta h=45$$

4.  $$mgh = \frac{1}{2}mv^2 \quad \Delta h = \frac{1}{2} \frac{v^2}{g} = \frac{(6.1 \text{ms}^{-1})^2}{2 \cdot 9.81 \text{ms}^{-2}} = 1.90 \text{m}$$

5.  There is no (air) resistance and the gravitational field is uniform or changes so slowly that it doesn't influence the final result. Also we assume that all actions take place on earth's surface.

## 2.2 Worked example

120kg 5m 4s
$$P = \frac{F \cdot d}{t} = \frac{mgd}{t} = \frac{120 \cdot 9.81 \cdot 5}{4} = 1470 W$$
$$ \text{efficiency} = \frac{1470 W}{3000 W} = 0.49$$

*(Image of a 4kg mass being lifted a height h, with an initial upward velocity of 8.5ms⁻¹ and final velocity of 3ms⁻¹)*
4kg, $v_i=8.5 \text{ms}^{-1}$, $W=F \cdot d$

$v_i=8.5 \text{ms}^{-1}$
$v_f=3 \text{ms}^{-1}$
$$\bar{v} = \frac{8.5+3}{2} = 5.75 \text{ms}^{-1}$$
$$ F = m \cdot g + F_d $$
$$ F_d \cdot 5.75 = 4 $$
$$ F_d = 0.696 $$
$$ F = m \cdot g + 0.696 = 4 \cdot 9.81 + 0.696 = 39.94 \text{N} $$
$$ a = \frac{F}{m} = \frac{39.94}{4} = 9.985 $$
$$ v_f^2 = v_i^2 + 2a\Delta x $$
$$ h = \frac{v_f^2-v_i^2}{2a} = \frac{(3^2-8.5^2)}{-2 \cdot 9.985} = 3.17 \text{m} $$

    (b) $$1.4 \cdot 9.81 \cdot 8.25 \approx 113 \text{J}$$
    a is bigger

2.  $$ W = F \Delta s \cos\theta = 120 \cdot 40 \cdot \cos30^{\circ} = 4157 \text{ J} $$

3.  a) $$ P = \frac{F \Delta s}{t} = \frac{mg \Delta s}{t} = \frac{0.5 \cdot 9.81 \cdot 0.8}{29} \approx 0.136 \text{W} $$
    b) $$ \text{Efficiency} = \frac{0.136}{1.2/30} = 0.327 \text{ or } 32.7\% $$

2.  We assume that the force the foot applies on the ball is consistent over the time of contact. We assume that
    - there is no air resistance
    - the ball doesn't start spinning
    - there is no heat produced
    - the collision is elastic
    ... most of this is insignificant.

3.  $$ \frac{40 \cdot \cos5^{\circ}}{32} \approx 1.25 \text{ seconds} $$

4.  a) The position of the ball could be tracked and velocity and acceleration be derived from it. Same goes for the feet of the players.
    b) Better technology allows for more precise measurements.

5.  a) The wind is applying a force that causes displacement at an angle to the force (not equal to 90°) to the turbines.
    b) $$ 6000 \frac{\text{m}^3}{\text{s}} \cdot 5 \text{s} = 270000 \approx 300000 \text{m}^3 $$
       $$ 270000 \text{m}^3 \cdot 1.2 \frac{\text{kg}}{\text{m}^3} = 324000 \text{kg} $$
       $$ E_k = \frac{1}{2}mv^2 = \frac{1}{2} 324000 \cdot 9^2 = 13,122,000 \text{ J} $$
       $$ 0.59 \times 13,122,000 \text{ J} \approx 7,742,000 \text{ J} \approx 8 \text{TJ} $$
    c) There is friction which causes wind, also the blades don't cover the entire area at every point in time.
    d) Wind turbines only provide power for the time where there is wind.

6.  $$ W = F \cdot \Delta s = 800 \text{N} \cdot 2\pi \cdot 3.7 \approx 18600 \text{ J} \approx 20 \text{kJ} $$
    $$ P = \frac{\Delta E}{t} = \frac{144 \cdot 18600}{60^2} = 744 \text{W} $$

7.  The ball will never return further back than where it was released, rather it will usually not quite make it to its initial location due to friction. It is important therefore that the person doesn't move towards the ball or increases the ball's kinetic energy, as the pendulum converts kinetic energy into gravitational potential energy. The instructions are needed to guarantee the student's safety.

8.  a) i. $$ 650 \text{N} \cos42^{\circ} \approx 483 \text{N} \approx 500 \text{N} $$
    ii. $$ W = F \cdot \Delta s = 483 \text{N} \cdot 15 \cdot 7 \text{m} = 50.72 \text{kJ} $$
    b) The angle between the direction of the force applied to the lawn mower and the direction of movement is smaller, meaning that the minimum force to displace the lawnmower significantly decreased.

9.  $$ m = 0.1 \text{kg} $$
    $$ \text{Weight} = m \cdot g = 0.1 \cdot 10 = 1 \text{N} $$
    $$ \text{Work} = F \cdot \Delta s = m \cdot g \cdot 1\text{m} = 1 \text{Nm} = 1 \text{J} $$
    $$ \text{Power} = \frac{\Delta W}{t} = \frac{1 \text{J}}{1 \text{s}} = 1 \text{W} $$

1.  a) $$ p = 240 \text{ kgms}^{-1} $$
    b) $$ p = 588 \text{ kgms}^{-1} $$
    c) $$ 0.000001 \times 0.05 = 5 \times 10^{-8} \text{ kgms}^{-1} $$

2.  $$ 60 \text{km/h} : 3.6 \approx 17 \text{ms}^{-1} $$
    $$ m=300\text{kg} $$
    $$ p = 300 \cdot 17 = 5100 \text{ kgms}^{-1} $$

3.  The acceleration can be smaller, as there is a larger distance over which the object is (de)accelerated. This in return means the force will also be smaller.

4.  $$ F = \frac{\Delta p}{\Delta t} \quad \text{Is for }\Delta t $$
    $$ \text{and } \Delta p = m\Delta v \approx 0.5\text{kg} \cdot 3\text{m/s} $$
    $$ F = \frac{0.5\text{kg} \cdot 3\text{ms}^{-1}}{1\text{s}} \approx 1.5\text{N} $$

3.  By pushing back on the boat with his feet to accelerate forward the boy exerts a force on the boat. As the third law states every force between two objects has a reaction force, therefore the boat also exerts a force on the boy, just in the opposite direction. As a result both objects drift apart.

3.  a) This would only be the case if no other force was acting on the ball between shot and impact. Also the direction of the cannon applying force, and duration of the impact have to be of equal time. Due p=mv which can be derived from Newton's second law of motion the momentum gained through the cannon is the same required to bring the ball to rest again. In both cases F is the slope of Δp in respect to time, therefore both lines are equal.
    b) As the Δp increases due to the higher velocity the force applied increases to due to $F=\frac{\Delta p}{\Delta t}$, given that Δt changes insignificantly. The different slopes can be explained by the different deflection rates of the material. They are both directly proportional to the force applied on the material.

4.  The collision is perfectly inelastic, meaning that the ball looses all its kinetic energy when taking the player as the reference frame. The combined momentum of the ball and keeper is countered by the muscle force of the keeper pushing his entire body with the ball forward. The momentum is canceled.
    $$ \text{momentum of ball} + \text{momentum of player} = (\text{mass of player} + \text{mass of ball} + \text{mass of earth})V $$
    where V is approaching 0 due to the enormous mass.
    The player passes on the momentum to the earth.

6.  By ejecting slime the bacteria have to apply a force on the slime to accelerate it. As stated by newton's third law of motion forces between two objects always have a reaction force, meaning that the slime also exerts an equal force on the bacteria. This in return also moves the bacteria. Also could add $F=\frac{\Delta p}{\Delta t}$ meaning that force creates momentum.
7.  a) The student can check if the velocity of the other ball is the same as the initial ball, due to p=mv. Also, to simplify things he could see if the height is the same for both balls this would mean that energy was conserved.
    b) 1. nearly all kinetic energy is transferred between the two outer balls and momentarily converted to gravitational potential energy.
       2. Some of the kinetic energy is lost to the middle balls due to imperfect elastic collisions.
       3. All kinetic energy has transformed into other types of energy, e.g. sound or heat. ✓

8.  a) when releasing the weight a force is applied on the right of the trolley. Due to F=m·a there has to be an acceleration, therefore the velocity must be increasing. Because p=mΔv the trolley now has a momentum.
    b) $$ F = m \cdot a $$
       $$ 2.85 = 0.35 \cdot a \quad a = \frac{F}{m} = \frac{mg}{m_1+m_2} \quad \frac{2.80}{2.81} \approx 0.995 \text{J} $$
       $$ a = 8.14 \text{ms}^{-2} $$

    c) $$ 11.1 \text{ms}^{-1} \times 0.35\text{kg} \approx 3.89 \text{kgms}^{-1} $$ ✓
    d) Both linear and rotational momentum are conserved individually, i.e. the net momentum of a system stays the same as long as there are no external forces acting upon the system. ✓ Stops the same before and after the collision.
    e) This must be a perfectly elastic collision as both trolleys have exactly the same mass. The moving trolley transfers all of its momentum to the stationary trolley. If p=0 then p=mv must be zero but only v can change as the velocity has to be zero. Therefore the trolley stops. The once stationary trolley moves on at the same speed as the other one initially.
    f) This is a perfectly inelastic collision where the moving trolley looses all of its kinetic energy taking the other trolley as the frame of reference. Explain that trolleys stick to gether and how then momentum is conserved.
    g) The two trolleys could be placed together with a force that forces both trolleys apart, e.g. two magnets. Also a collision could be simulated backwards, i.e. moving both trolleys at such speeds that they come to a rest when they collide. *only works for perfectly inelastic collisions*
    h) Each force between two objects has a reaction force. Newton's third law of motion (✓). Putting momentum into terms of Force:
       $$ F = \frac{\Delta f}{\Delta t} \quad F\Delta t = \Delta p $$
       any force applied over some time results in some momentum, or at least its change. This in return means that there is a reaction momentum to any reaction force that exists over time. Any collision results in a reaction momentum but might be more or less noticeable due to the other object's mass. Though it always prevails. The total change in momentum is zero.

10. a) Between 0 and 4ms the momentum stayed at a constant uniformly by 0.8 kgms⁻¹. Then between 4ms and 8ms it decreased steadily by 0.5 kgms⁻¹ to -1.2 kgms⁻¹.
    b) Due to Newton's third law to every force between two objects there exists a reaction force, which in this case causes the ball to accelerate in the opposite direction. This means that the ball reaches approximately the same speed into the opposite direction, and because p=mv there exists an equal opposite momentum. The player must have been moving towards the ball, else the magnitude of the ball's momentum wouldn't end up larger. ✓
