# 6.4 Atomic Electron Energies

## Electron Energy Levels

*(Diagram of a Bohr-like atom with concentric orbits for n₁, n₂, n₃)*

*   $n_1$ = ground state, the electron has least possible energy
*   $n_n$ = energy levels of the entire atom! (not electron orbits)
*   $E=0$ when $n=\infty$

e.g.
*(Energy level diagram showing levels n₁, n₂, n₃, n₄ getting closer together as they approach E=0)*

*   $E \rightarrow 0$
*   Energy approaches zero as the energy level becomes infinite
*   Providing an electron with more energy will make its energy less negative
*   Different energy levels have large ranges of possible energy values.
    -> ranges decrease as atoms become more free (e.g. gas)

## Excitation

=> The electron is provided with exactly the right amount of energy to jump to the next energy level
-> for isolated atoms with separate electrons too fast photons just pass by

*   A photon with an energy different to what would be required for a clean jump doesn't interact with the electron
*   The photon will completely disappear and give all its energy to the electron, if it carries the exactly right amount
*   collision with a particle (not photon) can also result in excitation
    -> e.g. when a high voltage is applied.

## De-Excitation

=> After a random amount of time the electron will drop down to some intermediate energy level or directly to the ground state
-> A photon with exactly the freed energy is released

## Line Spectra

=> When shining light into a substance (e.g. gas due to more exact energy levels) certain frequencies will be absorbed
=> When exciting atoms with a large potential difference many atoms will de-excite and release very specific wavelengths
-> lost electrons stem into neutral electrons
-> a line spectra can be created with a prism

### Emission Spectrum

*(Diagram of an emission spectrum with bright lines at certain wavelengths)*

### Absorption Spectrum

*(Diagram of an absorption spectrum with dark lines at certain wavelengths on a continuous spectrum background)*

## Intensity of Radiation

=> how much radiation energy will there be per second on a certain area?

$$ I = \frac{P}{A} $$

*   I ≙ intensity (Wm⁻²)
*   P ≙ Power for 1m² (W)
*   A ≙ Area (m²)

## Energy Level Diagrams

*(Diagram showing energy levels labeled "level A", "level B", and "Ground State" for Neon (Ne))*
*(An arrow indicates a transition from Ground State up to level A, labeled "632.8nm wavelength laser light" with a note "emphasize exact conditions needed to match energy levels")*
*(Two arrows show a step-wise transition from level A down to level B, and then level B down to Ground State, with a note "use arrows to emphasize the step-wise transition of energy levels")*
*(A note points to "Ne" indicating "atom type")*

## Ionisation

=> When the electron leaves the atom (n=∞), the atom will be ionised. The energy level for the electron is zero
=> The minimum energy required to move an electron from the atom's ground state outside of the atom is called ionisation energy
-> The ionisation energy is like the work function, but for an isolated atom, instead of a continuous metal surface

1.  $2.18 \times 10^{-18} - 5.45 \times 10^{-19} = 1.635 \times 10^{-18}$
    $$ E = hf \quad f = \frac{v}{\lambda} $$
    $$ E = h \frac{v}{\lambda} $$
    $$ \lambda = \frac{hv}{E} = \frac{6.63 \times 10^{-34} \cdot 3 \times 10^8}{1.635 \times 10^{-18}} = 1.22 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{m} $$

2.  Because $1.43 \times 10^{-18} \, \text{J}$ is smaller than the required $1.635 \times 10^{-18} \, \text{J}$ ✓

3.  $$ E=hf \quad f = \frac{v}{\lambda} $$
    $$ E = h \frac{v}{\lambda} = \frac{6.63 \times 10^{-34} \cdot 3 \times 10^8}{632.8 \times 10^{-9}} \div (1.6 \times 10^{-19}) \approx 2.0 \, \text{eV} \, ✓ $$

4.  When colliding with other particles, electrons can be excited too. One could apply a current to the gas. (send) ✓

5.  Mercury has many different energy levels, and when atoms change between them many different colors arrises ✓

6.  It must be a number extremely large ✓

## Test

1.  $$ E=hf \quad f = \frac{v}{\lambda} $$
    $$ E = \frac{hv}{\lambda} = \frac{6.63 \times 10^{-34} \cdot 3 \times 10^8}{550 \times 10^{-9}} = 3.6 \times 10^{-19} $$
    C ✓

2.  $2.18 \times 10^{-18} - 1.36 \times 10^{-19} = 20.44 \times 10^{-19}$
    $$ \lambda = \frac{hv}{E} = \frac{6.63 \times 10^{-34} \cdot 3 \times 10^8}{20.44 \times 10^{-19}} \approx 9 $$
    $$ f = \frac{E}{h} = \frac{20.44 \times 10^{-19}}{6.63 \times 10^{-34}} \approx 3.08 \times 10^{15} $$

6.  That frequency has to exceed a certain level to produce photoelectrons tells us that light has to travel as many individual packages of energy. The energy of the single colliding particle has to be sufficient. Increasing the amount would just result in more photoelectrons, as more collisions occur. (more detail) ✓

7.  
    a) The energy of the photons isn't sufficient to free any electrons ✓
    b) $m = h$
    $0 = 10^{15} \cdot 6.63 \times 10^{-34} + b$
    $b = -6.63 \times 10^{-19}$
    $ \phi = 6.63 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J}$ (convert to eV) ✓
    c) Plancks constant, the minimum possible change in energy (in the universe) ✓
    d) *(Graph of two parallel lines with positive slope)*
    They stay parallel ✓

    a) $$ v = f\lambda $$
        i. $$ f = \frac{v}{\lambda} = \frac{3 \times 10^8}{6.56 \times 10^{-7}} = 4.57 \times 10^{14} \, \text{Hz} \, ✓ $$
        ii. $$ \frac{3.03 \times 10^{-19}}{1.6 \times 10^{-19}} = 1.89 \, \text{eV} $$
        $$ 3.4 \, \text{eV} - 1.5 \, \text{eV} = 1.9 \, \text{eV} $$
        $1.89 \approx 1.9$ so from n3 to n2 ✓
    b) $$ E = h \cdot f \quad f = \frac{v}{\lambda} $$
    $$ E = h \cdot \frac{v}{\lambda} = \frac{6.63 \times 10^{-34} \cdot 3 \times 10^8}{656 \times 10^{-9}} = 3.03 \times 10^{-19} \, ✓ $$
    *(calculation not expected)*
    The hydrogen absorbs this frequency. It's precisely the energy needed to drop from n3 to n2. ✓ *(note: same as energy required for a drop from n3 to n2)*

9.  
    a) Ultraviolet light is a very short wave that provides each photon with sufficient energy to free an electron from an atom in its ground state. This means that the photon must have roughly equal or more energy than the zink's work function ✓
    -> Charge is reduced and the leave falls (V) ✓
    b) Visible light has longer wavelengths that carry less energy. The energy each photon carries doesn't exceed the Zink's work function ✓
    c) $$ E=hf \quad v=f\lambda \quad f=\frac{v}{\lambda} $$
    $$ E = \frac{hv}{\lambda} = \frac{6.63 \times 10^{-34} \cdot 3 \times 10^8}{2 \times 10^{-7}} = 9.945 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J} $$
    $$ (9.945 - 6.88) \times 10^{-19} $$
    $$ 3.065 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J} $$
    $$ E = \frac{1}{2} mv^2 $$
    $$ v = \sqrt{\frac{2E}{m}} = \sqrt{\frac{2 \cdot 3.065 \times 10^{-19}}{9.11 \times 10^{-31}}} = 8.20 \times 10^5 \, \text{ms}^{-1} \, ✓ $$
    Let's goo
    d) The speed will stay the same, as the wavelength doesn't change. ✓
