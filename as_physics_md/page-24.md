# 5.7 Refraction
=> The process of a wave changing direction when entering another medium.

## Explaination
*   a wave entering a different medium changes speed
*   due to $$v = \lambda f$$ the wavelength changes
*   when traveling at an angle, parts of the wave change speed early
    => the direction changes

(Diagram showing wave fronts moving from a "less dense" medium to a "denser" one, bending towards the "normal line". The wavelength in the denser medium is "smaller, slower".)

## Refractive Index
=> describes the ratio of light speed inside a vacuum to the speed inside the medium.
*   denoted 'n':
    $$n = \frac{c}{v}$$
    *   n = refractive index of medium
    *   c = speed of light (vacuum)
    *   v = speed of light (medium)
$$n_{Air} \approx 1.000$$

### Density correlation
*   higher density usually means higher refraction index
    => the relationship depends on more factors

## Angle Prediction (Snell's Law)
$$n_1 \sin\theta_1 = n_2 \sin\theta_2$$
*   n₁,₂ = refractive index of medium 1,2
*   θ₁,₂ = angle between ray 1,2 and normal

Note: $$ \theta $$ will always be larger in the less-dense medium.

*   $$ \theta_1 $$: incident angle
*   $$ \theta_2 $$: angle of refraction

## Dispersion
> formulae for medium 1 = air (1.00)
> $$ \sin\theta_1 = \frac{c \sin\theta_2}{f\lambda} \quad \sin\theta_2 = \frac{f\lambda \sin\theta_1}{c} $$

=> A phenomenon where different wave frequencies refract at slightly different angles.

### How Dispersion Works
*   different frequencies actually have slight variations in their refraction index for a medium
*   due to $$ n = \frac{c}{v} $$ we know light at different frequencies will move at different speeds
    => refract differently
*   smaller initial wavelength -> higher refraction index
    => larger angle of refraction outside medium
    => smaller angle of refraction inside medium

### Derive Dispersion Formulae
$$ n_1 \sin\theta_1 = n_2 \sin\theta_2 \quad n=\frac{c}{v} = \frac{c}{f\lambda} $$
$$ \frac{c}{f\lambda_1}\sin\theta_1 = \frac{c}{f\lambda_2}\sin\theta_2 \quad | \cdot \frac{f}{c} $$
$$ \frac{\sin\theta_1}{\lambda_1} = \frac{\sin\theta_2}{\lambda_2} $$

3. 
   $$ n_1 = 1.00 \quad n_2 = 1.50 $$
   $$ \theta_1 = 25^\circ \quad \theta_2 = ? $$

   $$ n_1 \sin\theta_1 = n_2 \sin\theta_2 $$
   $$ \sin\theta_2 = \frac{n_1 \sin\theta_1}{n_2} $$
   $$ \theta_2 = \sin^{-1}\left(\frac{n_1 \sin\theta_1}{n_2}\right) = \sin^{-1}\left(\frac{\sin 25^\circ}{1.5}\right) = 16.4^\circ $$
