# 2.11 Power in Electric Circuits

## Electrical Work
> The energy transfered when an electric force moves a charge through a potential difference.

$$W = V \times Q$$
$$W = VIt$$

- W = work (J)
- V = potential difference (V)
- Q = charge (C)
- I = current (A)
- t = time (s)

## Electrical Power
> The rate of which electrical work is done

$$P = VI$$
$$P = I^2R$$
$$P = \frac{V^2}{R}$$

- P = power (W)
- V = potential difference (V)
- I = current (A)
- R = resistance (Î©)

$$P = \frac{W}{t} = \frac{VIt}{t} = VI$$
$$P = VI = (IR)I = I^2R$$
$$P = VI = V(\frac{V}{R}) = \frac{V^2}{R}$$

## Efficiency
> Ratio of the useful energy/power output to the total energy output

*units cancel anyway*
$$efficiency = \frac{\text{useful power output}}{\text{total power output}} = \frac{\text{useful energy output}}{\text{total energy output}}$$

> efficiency describes how good a machine is at using energy usefully

## Questions

1.  $$W = VIT = 1.03 \times 1.8 \cdot 11 \approx 20.4 \text{ J}$$
2.  $$P = IV = 1.8 \times 1.03 \approx 1.85 \text{ W}$$
3.  a) $$P = I^2R = 1.76^2 \cdot 470 = 1456 \text{ W}$$
    b) $$P = \frac{V^2}{R} = \frac{5^2}{470} = 0.172 \text{ W}$$
4.  a) $$efficiency = \frac{W_{useful}}{W_{total}} = \frac{95}{100} = 0.95$$
    b) This is because if energy is supplied continuously, the ratio of energy spent usefully in relation to the total energy stays the same.
