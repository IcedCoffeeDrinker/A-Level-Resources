6.  When light hits the oil, part of it reflects and another part defracts due to the change of medium. The refracted light then reflects off the water's surface, defracts again and re-emerges at the air but at a different position. This means that there are many individual light sources due to the splitting that interfere with eachother and cause the pattern.
    > *want direct refference to path difference; missing: light is coherent*

7.  a) $$500 \cdot 1000 = 500 \, 000 \text{ per meter}$$
    $$d = \frac{1}{500 \, 000} = 2 \times 10^{-6} m$$
    b) $$n=1 \quad \theta=15^{\circ}$$
    $$\lambda n = d\sin\theta$$
    $$\lambda = \frac{d\sin\theta}{n} = \frac{2\times10^{-6} \sin(15^{\circ})}{1} = 5.18 \times 10^{-7} m$$
    c) $$\lambda = 450nm = 450 \times 10^{-9}m \quad \theta=80^{\circ}$$
    $$\lambda n = d\sin\theta$$
    $$n \approx \frac{d\sin\theta}{\lambda} = \frac{2\times10^{-6} \sin(80^{\circ})}{450 \times 10^{-9}} \approx 4.4 \approx 4$$

8.  a) $$v = \sqrt{\frac{T}{\mu}}$$
    *Unit Analysis:*
    $$ms^{-1} = \sqrt{\frac{N}{kgm^{-1}}} = \sqrt{\frac{kgms^{-2}}{kgm^{-1}}}$$
    $$ms^{-1} = \sqrt{\frac{m^2}{s^2}} = \frac{m}{s} = ms^{-1}$$
    *Note: $F=m \cdot a$, $N = kg \cdot ms^{-2}$*
    b) 
        i. The wave sent by the vibration generator is reflected off the pully and interferes with itself. As both waves are coherent, meaning their phase difference has a consistent relationship, a standing wave is produced.
        > *-> want refference to nodes and antinodes*
        ii. $$\lambda = 2m \cdot 2 = 4m$$ (1st harmonic)
        iii. $$v = \sqrt{\frac{T}{\mu}} = \sqrt{\frac{150}{0.005}} = 170ms^{-1}$$
        iv. As the frequency is increased, every time it hits a multiple of the 1st harmonic frequency, a standing wave is formed. Each new standing wave gains an additional node and antinode. At some point the string will snap.
        > *some more info, e.g. lower amplitude w more nodes*

9.  a) Diffraction describes the process of wave energy spreading arround corners or through slits.
    b) Superpositions are the patterns that result from multiple waves (wave sources) colliding. A superposition is the sum of all displacements at a given point, for all points.
    c) When the waves incide on the rocks, they diffract, i.e. spread around the rocks. As each wave re-emerges on the other side of the obstacle it acts as a new wave source that can interfere with the other waves. This interference creates a superposition - a wave pattern. Within this pattern there are areas where the waves interact constructively and destructively. At the edges of the pattern this causes different forces when acting on the sand. Over time the shape of the interference pattern becomes visible on the sand.

10. a) [Sketch of a standing wave, fundamental frequency, one antinode]
    b) [Sketch of a standing wave, third harmonic, three antinodes]
    c) When the string is released, two waves travel down the string in opposite directions. Both waves reflect off the ends and interfere with each other. They're coherent and therefore produce a standing wave if the frequency is just right, forming a standing wave.
