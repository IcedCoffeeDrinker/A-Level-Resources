# 5.5 Polarization
> The orientation of the plane along which transverse waves oscillate

## Light Composition
- any electromagnetic waves oscillate in two directions perpendicular to each other:
- vertical: electric field
- horizontal: magnetic field

*(Diagram showing perpendicular electric and magnetic field waves propagating)*

## Plane Polarization
- a wave is said to be 'plane polarized' when its transverse displacement happens along one plane
- natural light consists of many differently oriented waves
    ↳ each wave individually is plane polarized, but together they're not
- only transverse waves can be polarized

## Polarizing Filters
> allow only one plane polarization to pass and absorb or reflect the rest
- Types of filters:
    - sheet with slit for string polarization
    - 'polaroid sheet' for electromagnetic waves

*(Diagram showing the process of polarization)*
- (Light with oscillations in all directions) -> (vertical polarizer) -> (light with vertical oscillations) -> (horizontal polarizer) -> (no oscillations)
- hole: horizontal polarizing filter 
    ↳ allows horizontally polarized light to pass

## Crossed Polaroids
> Two polaroids that polarize light both vertically and horizontally, therefore blocking all light.

## Stress Analysis with Crossed Polaroids
*(Diagram showing light passing through crossed polaroids with an object like plastic/glass in between)*
- all light that doesn't get twisted by the transparent object gets blocked
- some light gets twisted by the object and travels slower through areas of high stress
- light traveling at different speeds causes an interference pattern related to the stress
- also different wavelenghts are twisted differently by the object

## Polarization By Reflection and Refraction
> Vertically polarized light has a higher tendency to refract into the surface
    ↳ Reflections tend to have horizontal plane polarization

*(Diagram showing unpolarized light reflecting and refracting, with the reflected light being horizontally polarized)*

- the degree of polarization depends on the angle of incidence
    ↳ steeper angle => less reflection

## Polarization by Sugar Solutions
> Sugar solutions are able to rotate the angle of the plane of polarization
- Factors that determine the emerging color:
    - sugar to water ratio -> how much twisted
    - distance for light in sugar solution -> more distance = more twisted
- crossed polaroids are required to see the effects

## Note
These notes only consider plane polarization, other types include:
- circular polarization -> rotation direction

## Radio Transmitter Polarization
- radio transmitters are often used for practical exams
- almost always are plane polarized
- this includes e.g. wifi, communication, radio

## Questions
1. Only transverse waves can be polarized, sound consists of longitudinal waves.
2. It means that the waves doesn't oscillate in a specific plane -> beam of randomly rotated electromagnetic waves.
3. To block the strong reflections that are contained in the horizontal component of all reflected light. Surfaces tend to horizontally polarize light.
4. One can look at stress within values where no pressure sensor could reach in. Engineers can tell where they need reinforcement.
