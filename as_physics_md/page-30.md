# 6.3 Electron diffraction & interference

=> All particles, especially small ones like electrons show wave-particle duality under certain circumstances.

*   electrons shot through a double slit one-by-one will still create an interference pattern.

## Davisson-Germer Diffraction Experiment

=> When shooting electrons at a nickel crystal they reflect off in a diffraction pattern.

*Diagram components:*
*   Filament (provides electrons)
*   Electrons
*   Anode (accelerates)
*   Nickel crystal
*   Detector
*   Rail

*   The detector is moved around the crystal to detect changes in reflected intensity.
*   A diffraction pattern is measured.

$$
\lambda = \frac{h}{p}
$$

## De Broglie Equation

=> The wavelength of an electron wave is inversely proportional to the electrons momentum.
=> Therefore inversely proportional to the speed (except close to speed of light.)

$$
\lambda = \frac{h}{p}
$$

*   λ ≙ wavelength (m)
*   h ≙ Planck's constant (J.s)
*   p ≙ momentum (kgms⁻¹)

### Explanation:

(Diagram showing a wave over a time interval)
$$ \Delta t = 1 \text{ second} $$
distance = _________

(Diagram showing a more compressed wave over the same time interval)
$$ \Delta t = 1 \text{ second} $$
distance = _________

=> more distance traveled in the same time,
=> smaller wavelength has particles that travel faster.

## Electron Microscope

=> The faster electrons are accelerated, the smaller their wavelength.

=> The wavelength has to be approximately equal or smaller than an object in order to be reflected.

## Questions?

1.  When electrons are shot through a double slit one-by-one, they will still produce a diffraction pattern. ✔
2.  Because the wavelength has to be roughly equal or smaller to the object in order to be reflected off of it. By accelerating the electron more it will have a smaller wavelength. ✔
3.  
    $$ E_{elec} = qV \text{ (energy = charge x potential difference)} $$
    $$ \frac{1}{2}mv^2 = E_{kin} $$
    $$ qV = \frac{1}{2}mv^2 $$
    $$ 1.602 \times 10^{-19} \cdot 400 = \frac{1}{2} \cdot 9.11 \times 10^{-31} v^2 $$
    $$ 3.52 \times 10^{11} = v^2 $$
    $$ v = 5.93 \times 10^5 \text{ ms}^{-1} $$
    $$ \lambda = \frac{h}{p} = \frac{6.62 \times 10^{-34}}{9.11 \times 10^{-31} \times 5.93 \times 10^5} = 3.00 \times 10^{-11} \text{ m} $$
4.  3kg, 20ms⁻¹
    $$ \lambda = \frac{1.62 \times 10^{-35}}{20 \cdot 3} \approx 2.7 \times 10^{-32} \text{ m} $$ ✔

## Test
$$ E_{el} = Vq \quad E_{kin} = \frac{1}{2}mv^2 $$
$$ Vq = \frac{1}{2}mv^2 $$
$$ m2Vq = v^2 $$
$$ v = \sqrt{2Vqm} $$
$$ \lambda = \frac{h}{m \cdot \sqrt{2Vqm}} = \frac{6.63 \times 10^{-34}}{9.11 \times 10^{-31} \cdot \sqrt{2 \cdot 800 \cdot 1.602 \times 10^{-19} / 9.11 \times 10^{-31}}} = 4.76 \times 10^{-13} \text{ m} $$

*Side Derivation:*
$$ \frac{2Vq}{m} = v^2 $$
$$ v = \sqrt{\frac{2Vq}{m}} $$
$$ \lambda = \frac{h}{m\sqrt{\frac{2Vq}{m}}} $$
$$ 4.34 \times 10^{-11} \text{m} \approx 0.0434 \text{nm} $$ ✔

## Isac Test
$$ E = hf = 6.626 \times 10^{-34} \cdot 6 \times 10^{14} = 5.7 \times 10^{-21} \text{J} $$
