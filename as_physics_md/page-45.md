# Exam Practice

1.  B ✓
2.  A ✓
3.  $$V_{ter} = \mathcal{E} - Ir$$
    $$r = \frac{\mathcal{E} - V_{ter.}}{I} = \frac{6-5.8}{0.44} = 0.45\Omega$$ B ✓
4.  C ✓
5.  A ✓
6.  
    a) ✓
    b) Bulb A will be brighter, as it has less resistance so more current flows through it. Both have the same dp across them, so current will be the only significant factor + $$P=\frac{V^2}{R}$$
7.  The voltage across both lamps is the same. Because B has a lower resistance, more current will flow through B. Due to $$P=IV$$ we know that when current increases the power will be larger for the component, so B will be brighter.
8.  
    a) $$V_{out} = V_{in} \frac{R_1}{R_1+R_2} = 9 \frac{40}{40+80} = 3V \checkmark\checkmark (3.0v)$$
    b) As the thermistor is in parallel with the 40Ω resistor, an increase in resistance through the thermistor means the overall resistance of the two resistors increases. The total resistance in the circuit increases, less current flows at the same voltage.
9.  
    a) $$P = \frac{V^2}{R}$$
    $$R = \frac{V^2}{P} = \frac{220^2}{1000} = 48.4\Omega \checkmark$$
    b) $$1000 \times 60 \times 3 = 180 000 J \checkmark$$
    c) 
        i. $$P = \frac{110^2}{48.4} = 250 W$$
        $$P \cdot t = w$$
        $$t = \frac{w}{P} = \frac{180000}{250} = 720s \text{ or } 12min \checkmark$$
        ii. Probably a fuse inside it would burn. Or the heater might burn if there is no fuse, as the power output would drastically increase due to $$P = \frac{V^2}{R}$$
10. 
    a) $$P=IV$$
    $$I = \frac{P}{V} = \frac{4.8}{230} = 0.021 A \checkmark$$
    b) 
        i. $$V \cdot A = W$$
        $$\frac{E}{Q} \cdot \frac{Q}{t} = W$$
        $$\frac{E}{t} = W$$
        $$W=W \checkmark$$
        *use units next time*
        ii. $$P_{out} = IV = 5 \times 0.5 = ~~2.5W~~ \text{ } 0.5W$$
        efficiency = $$\frac{0.5}{4.8} = 0.1042 \text{ or } 10.42\% \text{ } X$$
        (The original calculation `~~efficiency = 2.5/4.8 = 0.52 or 52%~~` is crossed out)
        iii. a lot of energy will be transferred into heat ✓
11. 
    a) 
        i) $$2 \times 0.2 + 3.6 = 4\Omega \checkmark$$
        ii) $$I = \frac{V}{R} = \frac{3}{4} = 0.75A \checkmark$$
        iii) $$P = I^2R = 0.75^2 \times 3.6 \approx 2.0W \checkmark$$
    b) As the internal resistance increases, a larger share of the power will be lost within the cell and the radiator will be also lit so lightly less hot. This is due to a decreased terminal voltage, and the equation $$P = \frac{V^2}{R}$$ stating that with less of a potential difference the power decreases too.
12. Hoffmann's Current Law states that the sum of all current entering a junction must equal the sum of currents leaving the junction. ✓ No current appears or disappears out of nowhere, current, and therefore charge, stay conserved. ✓

    Hoffman's Voltage Law states that the sum of all changes in voltage around a closed loop in a circuit must equal zero. The emf voltages perfectly cancel with all pds, as energy within the system has to stay conserved, and energy added must equal energy removed from the system. ✓
