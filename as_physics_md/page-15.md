# 4.4 Plotting Data

## How to Plot Graphs
1.  Determine the range of variables displayed and the grid's resolution
2.  Put independent variable on the x and dependent variable on the y
    -> Exceptions:
    - Hooke's Law x: l y: Force
    - Ohm's Law x: Voltage y: current
3.  The graph should cover at least half the given space on the paper
4.  Chose grid steps that are either in units of 1, 2, 5 or 10^n
5.  Label the x and y axis with a name and unit
6.  Plot points precisely using 'x' or '+'
7.  **Plot anomalous points!**
    -> circle them and add a note, stating:
    'this point is anomalous because...'
    -> Doesn't have to be included in best line of fit or calculations
8.  Draw a line connecting the dots, exceptions:
    - line of best fit instead if relation should be linear -> *doesn't have to pass origin*
    - connect with curves if dots approximate a curve
9.  Add a graph title: y-variable vs x-variable
10. you're allowed to interpolate.
    -> Don't use the line of best fit far from its range of data
11. **Always** show the gradient triangle (when calculating gradients)
    -> triangle should be larger than 8cm

### Example
Extension vs Load for a plastic spring

*anomalous measurement, researcher bumped into the weight

## Error Bars
=> used to indicate a possible error for data points

### Example
Extension vs Load for a plastic spring

#### Data
| Extension(mm) | Load(N)    |
| --------------- | ---------- |
| 0 ± 2mm         | 0 ± 0.25N  |
| .               | .          |
| .               | .          |
| .               | .          |

Line of best fit should pass each data point inside the area:

## Line of Best Fit
-   line that best approximates a linear relationship
-   doesn't have to pass origin
    -> should instead best match data
-   somewhat equal amounts of points on both sides
-   draw a confident line in one go

## Checklists for Experimentation
### After executing experiment: record...
-   all steps for the experiment execution
-   define and categorize dependent, independent, and control variables
-   major difficulties
-   ideas for improvement

### Plotting Graphs:
-   does the plotted data take up more than half of the sheet?
-   does the plot have a title?
-   are both axies labeled with
    -   variable name
    -   unit
-   are my points either 'x' or '+'?
-   are my data points accurate?
-   are all lines straight and confident?
-   is my gradient triangle existent and larger than 8cm?
    -> Did I show gradient calculations?
