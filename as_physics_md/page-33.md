# 7.1 Electric Current

## Electric Charge
- measured in coulombs (C)
- one electron charge equals:
  $$e = -1.602 \times 10^{-19} C$$
- The total charge always stays conserved

> ### Electromagnetic Force
> - one of the four fundamental forces in the universe
> - opposite charges repell, same charges attract

## Electric Current
=> The rate of movement of electric charge
- Occurs when a charge experiences an electric force
  ↳ the charge will accelerate, creating a current (if it's a conduction electron)
- Conduction electrons: electrons in a solid that are able to move
- The unit for current is 'A' for ampere, or $$\frac{coulombs}{second} = I$$

## Conventional Current vs Flow of Electrons
- Conventional current assumes the moving charges are positive,
  ↳ Particles move from positive to negative
- Actual electrons have a negative charge
  ↳ They move from negative to positive

## Amount of Charge moving through a Component over Time:
$$\Delta Q = I \Delta t$$
$\Delta Q \hat{=} \text{amount of charge (C)}$
$I \hat{=} \text{current (A) - ampere}$
$\Delta t \hat{=} \text{change in time (s)}$

## Positive Charge Carriers
- If ions are suspended e.g. in a liquid, it's possible that positively charged particles act as charge carriers
  ↳ This is also a respected circuit
- Charge on a proton = -e ($1.602 \times 10^{-19} C$)

## Questions
1. a) $$I = \frac{C}{s} = \frac{12.5 \times 10^{18} \times 1.602 \times 10^{-19}}{3.2}$$
   $$I = 0.626 \text{ A}$$ ✓
   
   b) $$Q = I \cdot \Delta t = 0.95 \cdot 8 = 7.6 \text{ C}$$ ✓

   c) $$\Delta t = \frac{Q}{I} = \frac{1.602 \times 10^{-19} \times 10^{11}}{0.68} = 2.36 \times 10^{-8} \text{ s}$$ ✓

2. a) $$\Delta t = \frac{Q}{I} = \frac{20 \times 10^{-9}}{0.12 \times 10^{-6}} = 0.167 \text{ s}$$ ✓
   
   b) $$\frac{20 \times 10^{-9}}{1.602 \times 10^{-19}} = 1.25 \times 10^{11} \text{ electrons}$$ ✓

3. $$0.01 \times 2 \times 6.02 \times 10^{23} = 1.2 \times 10^{22} \text{ e}$$
   $$I = \frac{Q \Delta}{\Delta t} = \frac{1.2 \times 10^{22} \times 1.602 \times 10^{-19}}{23 \times 60} = 1.398 \text{ A} \approx 1.40 \text{ A}$$ ✓
