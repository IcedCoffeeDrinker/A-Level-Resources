# 5.3 Wave Phase & Superposition

## Wavefronts
=> a way of visualizing wave patterns

A line is drawn through all points that currently have a chosen phase (not amplitude!)

Phase drawing:

or

## Wave Superposition
=> The resulting wave pattern when multiple waves collide
- The sum of all wave's displacement for every point on the pattern

## Interference

### Constructive interference:

### Destructive interference:

*Note: There is partial and complete destructive/constructive interference*

## Questions
1. a ray only gives the direction in which the wave travels while a wavefront shows all points that currently have the same phase. -> It shows the wave pattern. ✓
   - *both are always at right angles*
2. $$ \pi \text{ or } \pi + 2\pi n $$ ✓
3. 
   a) $$ 0 \text{ or } 2\pi $$ ✓
   b) $$ \pi $$ ✓
   c) $$ \pi + \pi(2) \cdot 2 = 5\pi $$ ✓
