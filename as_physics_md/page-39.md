# 4A Exam Practice

1.  $$V = \frac{E}{Q} = \frac{J}{C}$$ C
2.  $$\frac{1.42}{1.602 \times 10^{-19}} \cdot 60^2 = 3.19 \times 10^{22}$$ D ✓
3.  C ✓
4.  $$R = \frac{L\rho}{A} = \frac{2L\rho}{2A}$$ B ✓
5.  A potential difference describes a drop in voltage across a component which makes use of electric energy. Electromotive force describes the voltage across a component which adds energy to the system. ✓
6.  $$I = \frac{Q}{\Delta t} = \frac{2.6 \times 10^{26}}{15} = 2.78 \times 10^6 A$$
7.  
    a) $$I = nAve$$
    $$v = \frac{I}{nAe} = \frac{8 \times 10^{-3}}{(6 \times 10^{28} \times 3 \times 10^{-6} \times e)} = 2.77 \times 10^{-7} ms^{-1} \approx 3 \times 10^{-7} ms^{-1}$$ ✓
    b) $$I = nAve$$
    $$v = \frac{I}{nAe}$$
    Gold has much more free electrons, meaning for a current of 8mA many free electrons shift a tiny bit. Silicon has few free electrons, therefore electrons have to move much faster to achieve the same current.
    (An arrow points from "for silicon n is smaller, so v is larger" to the 'n' in the formula $$v = \frac{I}{nAe}$$)
    c) The resistance decreases, as more electrons move into the conduction band. ✓
8.  
    a) Resistivity is a fundamental property of each material, describing the resistance that a current of 1A experiences when traveling through a meter cubed of the material. Resistance describes how much the flow of current is opposed. and varies with shape. $$R = \frac{\rho l}{A}$$
    b) $$R = \frac{\rho l}{A} = \frac{1.7 \times 10^{-8} \times 0.5}{1 \times 10^{-6}} = 8.5 \times 10^{-3} \Omega$$ ✓
9.  
    a) The resistivity is a fundamental property to the material, while resistance varies with shape. ✓
    b) 
    (Diagram of a circuit with an Ohmmeter connected by crocodile clamps to a wire stretched along a ruler.)
    (Second diagram of a micrometer measuring the diameter of the wire.)

    I would measure the resistance in Ohm with an Ohmmeter.
    I would measure the wire's diameter in multiple places.
    $$A = \frac{\pi d^2}{4}$$

    (Graph of Resistance vs. Length)
    -   **Y-axis:** Resistance (Ω)
    -   **X-axis:** length (m)
    -   A straight line graph with a positive slope and a positive y-intercept.
    -   **Y-intercept:** circuit resistance (systematic error)
    -   **Slope:** $$m = \frac{\rho}{A}$$
    
    $$\rho = m \times \frac{\pi d^2}{4}$$
    
    $$R = \frac{\rho}{A} \times L + \text{resistance of rest circuit}$$
    $$ \begin{matrix} \downarrow & & \downarrow & & \downarrow & & \downarrow \\ y & = & m & & x & + & b \end{matrix} $$
10. 
    a) $$V=I \cdot R$$ X Current between two points is proportional to the voltage across both points.
    c) The filament gets very hot so the resistance drastically increases, as the atoms move around a lot more and more collisions occur with the electrons. ✓
11. 
    a) Diode ✓
    b) virtually infinite ✓
    c) $$I=0.42A$$
    $$R = \frac{V}{I} = \frac{0.7}{0.42} = 1.67 \Omega$$ ✓
    d) It can be used to restrict the flow of current in one direction and is often used to protect intricate circuits. ✓
12. 
    a) $$R = \frac{V}{I}$$ Connect both ends to a small power supply which provides e.g. 0.1V of potential difference. Include an ammeter and maybe another resistor for security, whose resistance can be subtracted later. Measure the current and the terminal voltage. ✓
    $$R = \frac{V}{I} - \text{security resistor}$$
    b) $$R = \frac{\rho l}{2A}$$ It would roughly half ✓
