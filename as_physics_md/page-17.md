# 5.1 Wave Basics

Waves transfer energy over oscillation.
**mechanical waves**: require a medium
**electromagnetic waves**: don't require a medium
â†³ slow down in a medium

## Showing physical representation:

### displacement vs. distance travelled
*A graph showing a sine wave with the y-axis as `displacement (cm)` and the x-axis as `distance travelled (cm)`. Labels on the graph include `wavelength`, `crest`, and `trough`.*
- Describes the displacement from the equilibrium position at any point of the wave.
- Is an accurate representation of the physical wave.
- Doesn't conclude the speed of the wave.

### displacement vs. time graph
*A graph showing a sine wave with the y-axis as `displacement (m)` and the x-axis as `time (s)`. Labels on the graph include `period (s)`, `Amplitude (m)`, and `equilibrium position`.*

## Find Wave Speed

$$v = f\lambda$$
Where:
- v = speed
- f = frequency = $$\frac{1}{T}$$
- $$\lambda$$ = wavelength
- T = period

or

$$v=st$$

## Phase

Phase describes where a point is relative to a complete cycle.
- $$2\pi$$ is a complete cycle.
- Phase is an offset so there is no absolute starting point.
- Measured as an angle, radians (sometimes degrees).

## Transverse waves
- Displacement is perpendicular to direction of movement.
    - e.g. light, water waves

## Longitudinal Waves
- Displacement is parallel to direction of movement.
    - e.g. sound

1.  0.2m, 80m, 5.5m

2.  $$v=st$$
    $$s = \frac{v}{f} = \frac{330}{3.75} = 88m$$

3.  $$v=f\lambda \quad v=st$$
    $$st = f\lambda$$
    distance x times = cycles per time x distance per cycle
    ~~$$st = c \cdot t \cdot s \cdot c$$~~
    ~~$$st = ((st))$$~~
