# 2.2 Networks: Hardware

# Hardware

packets: Traffic trough network is broken into more convenient little packets of data which can be sent in multiple pieces  

## Network Interface Controller / Card (NIC)

- located in each node / end-system
- contains a port for Ethernet or antennas for wireless connection
- All NICs have an identifier code called ‘Media Access Control address’, short ‘MAC address’
    - Each device that is able to connect to a network has one
    - It’s unique worldwide
    - It’s hardcoded into the device
    - It’s six bytes long and coded in Hexadecimal
    - First three pairs are the manufacturer code, the other three are unique

## Switch

- A device with lots of physical ports that connects devices within a LAN
- It forwards packages from one node to another within a LAN
- It doesn’t handle WLAN
- Uses MAC addresses to handle nodes
- mainly works with unicast, but is also capable of multi- and broadcast

## Router

- Forwards (routs) packets between networks → usually between LAN and WAN
- Uses local IP addresses to handle nodes. IP addresses are only unique to the local network

## Wireless Access Point (WAP)

- A device that allows wireless connections to a wired network using the Wi-Fi communication standard
- Can be standalone and connected to a router wire cable or might be integrated into the router itself (= a wireless router)
- Requires the connecting devices to have a Wireless Network interface Card (WNIC)
