# Networking
Networks: Connections between nodes to share resources

Node: Basically a device

# Networks benefits vs. difficulties

**Positives**

- Speeds up communication locally and over wider distances (e.g. globally)
- Enables efficient use of resources → centralized computational power (server), or multiple computers using one single printer

**Negatives**

- Usually hard and costly to set up a new network
- Gets messy fast and often requires experts (network engineers) for maintenance
- Usually the network infrastructure is hard to modify once set up (they are fixed in their arrangement)

# Types of Networks

**personal area network (PAN):** within the range of an individual person (e.g. bluetooth) approx. 10 meters 

**local area network (LAN):** connects devices close to another, e.g same house or school

**wide area network (WAN):** a network that expands over a large location, sometimes even multiple, e.g. the internet, this is usually not owned by oneself

# Types Of Communication

- Types of message
    - unicast: addressing only one node
    - multicast: addressing multiple nodes
    - broadcast: addressing all nodes on the network
- Types of connections
    - simplex: data can travel only one way
    - half-duplex: data can travel both ways, but only one way at a time
    - full-duplex: data can travel both ways simultaneously

# Client-Server network

- Every device is either a a client or a server
- The clients connect over a network to the server
- Servers store and backup data centrally → centralized control
- Negatives:
    - Clients dependent on server’s speed and security (pro: the network doesn’t slow down because of a single slow client)
    - Server holds responsibility over data, which can go lost if the server doesn’t back up properly
    - Servers cost a lot (usually)
- Use-case examples:
    - A centralized database to save large files
    - Applications and websites that take to computational effort away from the client
    - A service that can be used in return for a transaction, hosted on a server on the web

# Peer-to-Peer network

- There is no central server
- Every device has equal responsibility and can work as both a client and server (not at the same time but they can switch)
- Negatives:
    - The network is slowed dow by slow nodes
    - No centralized control means no managed security, administration (service updates), or backups
    - E.g. Malware spreads easily on P2P because of insufficient security of some clients
    - Illegal documents are shared easily because not a single computer holds all responsibility

# Factors Affecting Performance

- Latency: How fast the signals travel
- Bandwidth: at what rate the data is transferred (bps)
- Error rate: how often does the data corrupt and has to be resent - rate of corruption
- Attenuation: The signal getting weaker when using higher frequencies (higher frequency = larger bandwidth) → amplifiers might be needed

# Wireless vs. Wired connection

- Wired connections are usually faster
- For Wireless Networks the bandwidth is shared across the network, meaning that the network can get congested
- Wireless is vulnerable to interference (data collision) happens when two devices use the same frequency
- certain wireless transmission frequencies are regulated by the government, a permit is needed
- cables can only be laid with permission of the landowner
- Global communication uses either fibre optic or satellite
- Wireless is much more affected by interference
- More repeaters are need for cable, neglecting building interference and fibre optic

## Types of wired connections (guided media)

- **twisted pair:** cheap, low bandwidth and data rate, easily affected by interference
    - LAN and local telephone
- **Coaxial:** more expensive, higher bandwidth and data rate, high need for amplifiers
    - TV
- **fibre-optic:** most expensive, highest bandwidth and data rate, no significant attenuation, not vulnerable to interference
    - Long-distance

## Types of wireless connections (unguided media)

- radio (3kHz-3GHz), microwave (3-300GHz), infrared (300GHz - 400THz)
    - Bandwidth / data rate —>
    - Need for repeaters —>
    - Directional focusing —>
    - Wall penetration <—

# Satellite networking

- Geostationary orbit (GEO) over equator: 35,786km
    - full coverage: 3 satellites
- medium-Earth-orbit (MEO): 15,000km
    - full coverage: 10 satellites
- low-Earth-orbit (LEO): 5,000km
    - full coverage: 50 satellites
- Transmission delays can cause technical problems

# Network Topologies

## Five requirements for a data communications system:

1. sender 
2. receiver
3. transmission medium
4. message
5. protocol 

## Ways data can move:

- **simplex mode:** data flows only in one direction
- **half duplex:** data can flow both ways but not simultaneously
- **full duplex:** data can flow both ways all time

## Types of messages:

- **broadcast:** one-to-all communication
- **multicast:** one source, multiple destinations
- **unicast:** one-to-one

## Bus Topology

- All devices are connected to the same link, like a highway that routs all messages to all clients. This is considered a multi-point connection, as instead of individual connections, all clients share the same ‘highway’. Only broadcasts can be sent.
- At the two ends of the bus are terminators which prevent the signal from reflecting at the ends
- To extend a bus network, two bus cables are linked with a repeater which allows for larger distances to be covered

## Star Topology

- All nodes (servers and clients!) are connected to a central switch, usually a router. The router then connects to the outside, e.g. internet
- Benefits:
    - Low cost, you only need one router and a bunch of cables
    - Easily expandable, you can just add connections to a router, to some degree
    - Makes it easy to identify issues in the network, nodes are not dependent on each other. When a node breaks down it doesn’t affect the entire network
- Negatives:
    - Your entire network is dependent on a single device, if the router goes down, everything goes down.

## Mesh Topology

- Every node is connected to all other nodes in the network
- Usually used in MAN and WAN e.g. like Telekom and global networks. Not really used for LAN
- Benefits:
    - If a connection breaks, data can just be routed over another node to the destination node
    - The more nodes you add the more alternative paths exist
- Negatives:
    - The amount of connections grows fast
    - It’s expensive to connect all nodes, each computer needs to have many ports for cables → more expensive hardware

# LAN vs. WAN

- LANs use routers to connect to WANS. This enables clients in the LAN to make connections to any servers connected to the WAN through with their own router.
- WAN usually requires public IP addresses
